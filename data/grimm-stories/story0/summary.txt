A wolf and a fox are companions. The wolf calls constantly for the fox to get him food. Each time the fox gets the wolf food, the wolf is not satisfied with what he has gotten and goes back by himself for more. Each time he goes back, the wolf is hurt when he is caught in his attempt to get more food. Finally, the wolf and fox go together to get salted meat out of a cellar. The fox stays on his guard, making sure no one is coming and that he has not made himself so fat that he cannot fit back through the door of the cellar. The wolf, on the other hand, eats so much that when the owner of the cellar comes, he cannot get out of the cellar and is killed.
