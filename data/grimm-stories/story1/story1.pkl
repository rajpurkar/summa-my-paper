S'Four young sparrows are knocked out of their nest boys but escape without harm. The father sparrow is sad that he did not teach the sparrows how to take care of themselves. When they are reunited later, he questions them about their chosen lifestyles. One sparrow lives in a garden, another in the stables, and one near the highway. The fourth and youngest sparrow has taken up residence in a church where he has learned about the provision and love of God. The father admits this fourth sparrow has found the best refuge, a place where he will always be cared for properly.'

S"A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow's nest.  When they\nwere fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but\nfortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind.  Then\nthe old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into\nthe world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger,\nand given them good instruction how to deal with each.\nIn the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a\nwheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again,\nand full of joy took them home with him.  Ah, my dear sons, how\nI have been worrying about you all through the summer, because you\ngot away in the wind without my teaching.  Listen to my words,\nobey your father, and be well on your guard.  Little birds have\nto encounter great dangers.  And then he asked the eldest where\nhe had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself.  I\nstayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms,\nuntil the cherries were ripe.  Ah, my son, said the father,\ntit-bits\nare not bad, but there is great risk about them.  On that account\ntake great care of yourself henceforth, and particularly when\npeople are going about the gardens who carry long green poles\nwhich are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top.  Yes,\nfather, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole\nwith wax, said the son.  Where have you seen that.  In a\nmerchant's garden, said the youngster.  Oh, my son, merchant folks\nare smart folks, said the father.  If you have been among the\nchildren of the world, you have learned worldly craftiness enough,\nonly see that you use it well, and do not be too confident.\nThen he asked the next, where have you passed your time.  At\ncourt, said the son.  Sparrows and silly little birds are of\nno use in that place.  There one finds much gold, velvet, silk,\narmor, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and lanners.  Keep\nto the horses, stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and\nthen fortune may give you your daily grain of corn in peace.  Yes,\nfather, said the son, but when the stable-boys make traps and fix\ntheir gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught.\nWhere have you seen that, said the old bird.  At court, among the\nstable-boys.  Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys.  If you\nhave been to court and among the lords, and have left no feathers\nthere, you have learnt a fair amount, and will know very well\nhow to go about the world, but look around you and above you,\nfor the wolves often devour the wisest dogs.\nThe father examined the third also, where did you seek your\nfortune.  I have cast my tub and rope on the cart-roads and\nhighways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley.  That\nis indeed dainty fare, said the father, but take care what you\nare about and look carefully around, especially when you see\nanyone stooping and about to pick up a stone, for then\nyou have not much time to waste.  That is true, said the son,\nbut what if anyone should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready\nbeforehand in his breast or pocket.  Where have you seen that.\nAmong the miners, dear father.  When they get out of the pit,\nthey generally take little bits of ore with them.  Mining folks\nare working folks, and clever folks.\nIf you have been among mining lads, you have seen and learnt\nsomething, but when you go thither beware, for many a sparrow\nhas been brought to a bad end by a mining boy throwing a piece\nof cobalt.\nAt length the father came to the youngest son, you, my dear\nchirping nestling, were always the silliest and weakest.  Stay\nwith me, the world has many rough, wicked birds which have\ncrooked beaks and long claws, and lie in wait for poor little\nbirds and swallow them.  Keep with those of your own kind, and\npick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees, or the\nhouses, and then you will live long in peace.  My dear father,\nhe who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well,\nand no sparrow-hawk, eagle, or kite will hurt him if he commits\nhimself and his lawful food, evening and morning, faithfully to\nGod, who is the creator and preserver of all forest and village\nbirds, who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young\nravens, for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except\nby his will.  Where have you learnt this.  The son answered,\nwhen the great blast of wind tore me away from you I came to a\nchurch, and there during the summer I have picked up the flies\nand spiders from the windows, and heard this discourse preached.\nThe father of all sparrows fed me all the\nsummer through, and kept me from all misfortune and from\nferocious birds.  Indeed, my dear son, if you take refuge in\nthe churches and help to clear away spiders and buzzing flies,\nand chirp unto God like the young ravens, and commend\nyourself to the eternal creator, all will be well with you,\nand that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds.\n               He who to God commits his ways,\n               in silence suffers, waits, and prays,\n               preserves his faith and conscience pure,\n               he is of God's protection sure.\n"
