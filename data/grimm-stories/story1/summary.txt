Four young sparrows are knocked out of their nest boys but escape without harm. The father sparrow is sad that he did not teach the sparrows how to take care of themselves. When they are reunited later, he questions them about their chosen lifestyles. One sparrow lives in a garden, another in the stables, and one near the highway. The fourth and youngest sparrow has taken up residence in a church where he has learned about the provision and love of God. The father admits this fourth sparrow has found the best refuge, a place where he will always be cared for properly.
