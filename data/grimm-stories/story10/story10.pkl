S"Returning from war with no money, a soldier makes a deal with the devil to work in hell for seven years. Although he has been ordered not to look in the kettles that simmer above hell's fires, Hans looks and sees his former corporal in one kettle, his former ensign in one, and his former general in another. Because he adds fresh logs to these fires, Hans saves his own life, and after his seven years of labor he is sent forth from hell back to earth. During his time in hell he was not allowed to cut his hair or nails or clean himself. At the inn where Hans stops, the landlord refuses to let him in until he sees Hans has gold.

S'A discharged soldier had nothing to live on, and did not know how to\nmake his way.  So he went out into the forest and when he had walked\nfor a short time, he met a little man who turned out to be the devil.\nThe little man said to him, "What ails you, you seem so very\nsorrowful?" Then the soldier said, "I am hungry, but have no money."\nThe devil said, "If you will hire yourself to me, and be my\nserving-man, you shall have enough for all your life.  You shall\nserve me for seven years, and after that you shall again be free. But\none thing I must tell you, and that is, you must not wash, comb, or\ntrim yourself, or cut your hair or nails, or wipe the water from your\neyes." The soldier said, "All right, if there is no help for it," and\nwent off with the little man, who straightway led him down into hell.\nThen he told him what he had to do.  He was to poke the fire under\nthe kettles wherein the hell-broth was stewing, keep the house clean,\ndrive all the sweepings behind the doors, and see that everything was\nin order, but if he once peeped into the kettles, it would go ill\nwith him.  The soldier said, "Good, I will take care." And then the\nold devil went out again on his wanderings, and the soldier entered\nupon his new duties, made the fire, and swept the dirt well behind\nthe doors, just as he had been bidden.\n\nWhen the old devil came back again, he looked to see if all had been\ndone, appeared satisfied, and went forth a second time.  The soldier\nnow took a good look on every side, the kettles were standing all\nround hell with a mighty fire below them, and inside they were\nboiling and sputtering.  He would have given anything to look inside\nthem, if the devil had not so particularly forbidden him.\n\nAt last he could no longer restrain himself, slightly raised the lid\nof the first kettle, and peeped in, and there he saw his former\ncorporal sitting. "Aha, old bird," said he, "do I meet you here?  You\nonce had me in your power, now I have you." And he quickly let the\nlid fall, poked the fire, and added a fresh log.  After that, he went\nto the second kettle, raised its lid also a little, and peeped in and\nthere sat his former ensign.  "Aha, old bird, so I find you here, you\nonce had me in your power, now I have you." He closed the lid again,\nand fetched yet another log to make it really hot.  Then he wanted to\nsee who might be sitting up in the third kettle - and who should it\nbe but his general.  "Aha, old bird, do I meet you here.  Once you\nhad me in your power, now I have you." And he fetched the bellows and\nmade hell-fire blaze right under him.\n\nSo he did his work seven years in hell, did not wash, comb, or trim\nhimself, or cut his hair or nails, or wash the water out of his eyes,\nand the seven years seemed so short to him that he thought he had\nonly been half a year.  Now when the time had fully gone by, the\ndevil came and said, "Well Hans, what have you done?" "I poked the\nfire under the kettles, and I have swept all the dirt well behind the\ndoors."\n\n"But you have peeped into the kettles as well, it is lucky for you\nthat you added fresh logs to them, or else your life would have been\nforfeited.  Now that your time is up, will you go home again?" "Yes,"\nsaid the soldier, "I should very much like to see what my father is\ndoing at home." The devil said, "In order that you may receive the\nwages you have earned, go and fill your knapsack full of the\nsweepings, and take it home with you.  You must also go unwashed and\nuncombed, with long hair on your head and beard, and with uncut nails\nand dim eyes, and when you are asked whence you come, you must say,\nfrom hell, and when you are asked who you are, you are to say, the\ndevil\'s sooty brother, and my king as well."\n\nThe soldier held his peace, and did as the devil bade him, but he was\nnot at all satisfied with his wages. Then as soon as he was up in the\nforest again, he took his knapsack from his back, to empty it, but on\nopening it, the sweepings had become pure gold.  "I should never have\nexpected that," said he, and was well pleased, and entered the town.\nThe landlord was standing in front of the inn, and when he saw the\nsoldier approaching, he was terrified, because Hans looked such a\nhorrible sight, worse than a scare-crow.  He called to him and asked,\n"Whence do you come?" "From hell." "Who are you?" "The devil\'s sooty\nbrother, and my king as well." Then the host would not let him enter,\nbut when Hans showed him the gold, he came and unlatched the door\nhimself.  Hans then ordered the best room and attendance, ate, and\ndrank his fill, but neither washed nor combed himself as the devil\nhad bidden him, and at last lay down to sleep.  But the knapsack full\nof gold remained before the eyes of the landlord, and left him no\npeace, and during the night he crept in and stole it away.  Next\nmorning, however, when Hans got up and wanted to pay the landlord and\ntravel further, behold his knapsack was gone.  But he soon composed\nhimself and thought, you have been unfortunate from no fault of your\nown.  And straightway went back again to hell, complained of his\nmisfortune to the old devil, and begged for his help.  The devil\nsaid, "Seat yourself, I will wash, comb, and trim you, cut your hair\nand nails, and wash your eyes for you." And when he had done with\nhim, he gave him the knapsack back again full of sweepings, and said,\n"Go and tell the landlord that he must return you your money, or else\nI will come and fetch him, and he shall poke the fire in your place."\nHans went up and said to the landlord, "You have stolen my money, if\nyou do not return it, you shall go down to hell in my place, and will\nlook as horrible as I." Then the landlord gave him the money, and\nmore besides, only begging him to keep it secret.  And Hans was now a\nrich man.\n\nHe set out on his way home to his father, bought himself a shabby\nsmock to wear, and strolled about making music, for he had learned to\ndo that while he was with the devil in hell.\n\nThere was however, an old king in that country, before whom he had to\nplay, and the king was so delighted with his playing, that he\npromised him his eldest daughter in marriage.  But when she heard\nthat she was to be married to a common fellow in a smock, she said,\n"Rather than do that, I would go into the deepest water." Then the\nking gave him the youngest, who was quite willing to do it to please\nher father, and thus the devil\'s sooty brother got the king\'s\ndaughter, and when the aged king died, the whole kingdom likewise.\n\n'
