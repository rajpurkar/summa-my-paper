S"A king had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure,\nbut so proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good\nenough for her.  She sent away one after the other, and\nridiculed them as well.\n\nOnce the king made a great feast and invited thereto, from far\nand near, all the young men likely to marry.  They were all\nmarshalled in a row according to their rank and standing.  First\ncame the kings, then the grand-dukes, then the princes, the\nearls, the barons, and the gentry.  Then the king's daughter was\nled through the ranks, but to each one she had some objection\nto make.  One was too fat, the wine-barrel, she said.  Another\nwas too tall, long and thin has little in.  The third was too\nshort, short and thick is never quick.  The fourth was too\npale, as pale as death.  The fifth too red, a fighting cock.\nThe sixth was not straight enough, a green log dried behind\nthe stove.\n\nSo she had something to say against each one, but she made\nherself especially merry over a good king who stood quite\nhigh up in the row, and whose chin had grown a little crooked.\nLook, she cried and laughed, he has a chin like a thrush's\nbeak. And from that time he got the name of king thrushbeard.\n\nBut the old king, when he saw that his daugher did nothing\nbut mock the people, and despised all the suitors who were\ngathered there, was very angry, and swore that she should have\nfor her husband the very first beggar that came to his doors.\n\nA few days afterwards a fiddler came and sang beneath the\nwindows, trying to earn a few pennies.  When the king heard him\nhe said, let him come up.  So the fiddler came in, in his dirty,\nragged clothes, and sang before the king and his daughter, and\nwhen he had ended he asked for a trifling gift.  The king said,\nyour song has pleased me so well that I will give you my\ndaughter there, to wife.\n\nThe king's daughter shuddered, but the king said, I have taken\nan oath to give you to the very first beggar-man and I will keep\nit.  All she could say was in vain.  The priest was brought,\nand she had to let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the\nspot.  When that was done the king said, now it is not proper\nfor you, a beggar-woman, to stay any longer in my palace, you may\njust go away with your husband.\n\nThe beggar-man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to\nwalk away on foot with him.  When they came to a large forest\nshe asked, to whom does that beautiful forest belong.  It\nbelongs to king thrushbeard.  If you had taken him, it would\nhave been yours.  Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken\nking thrushbeard.\n\nAfterwards they came to a meadow, and she asked again, to whom\ndoes this beautiful green meadow belong.  It belongs to king\nthrushbeard.  If you had taken him, it would have been\nyours.  Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken king\nthrushbeard.\n\nThen they came to a large town, and she asked again, to whom\ndoes this fine large town belong.  It belongs to king thrushbeard.\nIf you had taken him, it would have been yours.  Ah, unhappy\ngirl that I am, if I had but taken king thrushbeard.\nIt does not please me, said the fiddler, to hear you always\nwishing for another husband.  Am I not good enough for you.\n\nAt last they came to a very little hut, and she said, oh\ngoodness.  What a small house.  To whom does this miserable,\ntiny hovel belong.  The fiddler answered, that is my house and\nyours, where we shall live together.\n\nShe had to stoop in order to go in at the low door.  Where are\nthe servants, said the king's daughter.  What servants, answered\nthe beggar-man.  You must yourself do what you wish to have done.\nJust make a fire at once, and set on water to cook my supper,\nI am quite tired.  But the king's daughter knew nothing about\nlighting fires or cooking, and the beggar-man had to lend a\nhand himself to get anything fairly done.  When they had\nfinished their scanty meal they went to bed.  But he forced\nher to get up quite early in the morning in order to look after\nthe house.\n\nFor a few days they lived in this way as well as might be, and\ncame to the end of all their provisions.  Then the man said,\nwife, we cannot go on any longer eating and drinking here and\nearning nothing.  You must make baskets.  He went out, cut some\nwillows, and brought them home.  Then she began to make baskets,\nbut the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.\n\nI see that this will not do, said the man.  You had better spin,\nperhaps you can do that better.  She sat down and tried to spin,\nbut the hard thread soon cut her soft fingers so that the blood\nran down.  See, said the man, you are fit for no sort of work.\nI have made a bad bargain with you.  Now I will try to make a\nbusiness with pots and earthenware.  You must sit in the\nmarket-place and sell the ware.  Alas, thought she, if any of\nthe people from my father's kingdom come to the market and see\nme sitting there, selling, how they will mock me.  But it was\nof no use, she had to yield unless she chose to die of hunger.\nFor the first time she succeeded well, for the people were glad\nto buy the woman's wares because she was good-looking, and\nthey paid her what she asked.  Many even gave her the money and\nleft the pots with her as well.  So they lived on what she had\nearned as long as it lasted, then the husband bought a lot of\nnew crockery.  With this she sat down at the corner of the\nmarket-place, and set it out round about her ready for sale.\nBut suddenly there came a drunken hussar galloping along, and\nhe rode right amongst the pots so that they were all broken into\na thousand bits.  She began\nto weep, and did now know what to do for fear.  Alas, what will\nhappen to me, cried she.  What will my husband say to this.\nShe ran home and told him of the misfortune.  Who would seat\nherself at a corner of the market-place with crockery, said\nthe man.  Leave off crying, I see very well that you cannot\ndo any ordinary work, so I have been to our king's palace and\nhave asked whether they cannot find a place for a kitchen-maid,\nand they have promised me to take you.  In that way you will\nget your food for nothing.\n\nThe king's daughter was now a kitchen-maid, and had to be at\nthe cook's beck and call, and do the dirtiest work.  In both her\npockets she fastened a little jar, in which she took home her\nshare of the leavings, and upon this they lived.\n\nIt happened that the wedding of the king's eldest son was to be\ncelebrated, so the poor woman went up and placed herself by\nthe door of the hall to look on.  When all the candles were lit,\nand people, each more beautiful than the other, entered, and\nall was full of pomp and splendor, she thought of her lot with\na sad heart, and cursed the pride and haughtiness which had\nhumbled her and brought her to so great poverty.\n\nThe smell of the delicious dishes which were being taken in\nand out reached her, and now and then the servants threw her\na few morsels of them.  These she put in her jars to take home.\n\nAll at once the king's son entered, clothed in velvet and silk,\nwith gold chains about his neck.  And when he saw the\nbeautiful woman standing by the door he seized her by the hand,\nand would have danced with her.  But she refused and shrank\nwith fear, for she saw that it was king thrushbeard, her\nsuitor whom she had driven away with scorn.  Her struggles\nwere of no avail, he drew her into the hall.  But the string\nby which her pockets were hung broke, the pots fell down, the\nsoup ran out, and the scraps were scattered all about.  And\nwhen the people saw it, there arose general laughter and\nderision, and she was so ashamed that she would rather have\nbeen a thousand fathoms below the ground.  She sprang to the\ndoor and would have run away, but on the stairs a man caught\nher and brought her back.  And when she looked at him it was\nking thrushbeard again.  He said to her kindly, do not be\nafraid, I and the fiddler who has been living with you in that\nwretched hovel are one.  For love of you I disguised myself\nso.  And I also was the hussar who rode through your crockery.\nThis was all done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish\nyou for the insolence with which you mocked me.\n\nThen she wept bitterly and said, I have done great wrong, and\nam not worthy to be your wife.  But he said, be comforted,\nthe evil days are past.  Now we will celebrate our wedding.\nThen the maids-in-waiting came and put on her the most splendid\nclothing, and her father and his whole court came and wished\nher happiness in her marriage with king thrushbeard, and\nthe joy now began in earnest.  I wish you and I had been there\ntoo.\n"
