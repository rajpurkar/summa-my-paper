S"A count sends his son three times to learn with a private master. Each time the boy learns only the language of an animal. The first time the animal is a dog, the second a frog, and the third the birds. The count disowns the boy and sends him away. One night the boy stops at a castle where he finds a hidden treasure because he knows the language of the dog. The boy finds the treasure and the king adopts the boy as his own son. Eventually, the boy becomes pope. Although he doesn't know the prayers or masses, the birds sit on his shoulders and repeat to him what he should say. "

S"An aged count once lived in switzerland, who had an only son,\nbut he was stupid, and could learn nothing.  Then said the\nfather, hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into\nyour head.  You must go from hence, I will give you into the\ncare of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do\nwith you.  The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a\nwhole year with the master.  At the end of this time, he came\nhome again, and his father asked, now, my son, what have you\nlearnt.  Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.\n\nLord have mercy on us, cried the father, is that all you have\nlearnt.  I will send you into another town, to another master.\nThe youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master\nlikewise.  When he came back the father again asked, my son,\nwhat have you learnt.  He answered, father, I have learnt what\nthe birds say.  Then the father fell into a rage and said, oh,\nyou lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing,\nare you not ashamed to appear before my eyes.  I will send you\nto a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also,\nI will no longer be your father.  The youth remained a whole year\nwith the third master also, and when he came home again, and\nhis father inquired, my son, what have you learnt.  He\nanswered, dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs\ncroak.  Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang\nup, called his people thither, and said, this man is no longer\nmy son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into\nthe forest, and kill him.  They took him forth, but when they\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and\nlet him go, and they cut the eyes and the tongue out of a deer\nthat they might carry them to the old man as a token.\n\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress\nwhere he begged for a night's lodging.  Yes, said the lord of\nthe castle, if you will pass the night down there in the old\ntower, go thither, but I warn you, it is at the peril of your\nlife, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without\nstopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them,\nwhom they at once devour.  The whole district was in sorrow\nand dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything\nto stop this.  The youth, however, was without fear, and said,\njust let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something\nthat I can throw to them, they will do nothing to harm me.\n\nAs he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for\nthe wild animals, and led him down to the tower.  When he went\ninside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails\nquite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did\nnot hurt one hair of his head.  Next morning, to the astonishment\nof everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said\nto the lord of the castle, the dogs have revealed to me, in\ntheir own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on\nthe land.  They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a\ngreat treasure which is below in the tower, and they can\nhave no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt,\nfrom their discourse, how that is to be done.  Then all who\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would\nadopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully.  He\nwent down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it\nthoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him.\n\nThe howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more, they\nhad disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.\nAfter some time he took it into his head that he would travel to\nRome. On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of\nfrogs were sitting croaking.  He listened to them, and when he\nbecame aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful\nand sad.  At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died,\nand there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they\nshould appoint as his successor.  They at length agreed that\nthe person should be chosen as Pope who should be distinguished\nby some divine and miraculous token.  And just as that was decided\non, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting\nthere.  The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above,\nand asked him on the spot if he would be Pope.  He was undecided,\nand knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled\nhim to do it, and at length he said yes.  Then was he anointed and\nconsecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the\nfrogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be\nhis holiness the Pope.  Then he had to sing a mass, and did not\nknow one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.\n"
