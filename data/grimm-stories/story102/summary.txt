A count sends his son three times to learn with a private master. Each time the boy learns only the language of an animal. The first time the animal is a dog, the second a frog, and the third the birds. The count disowns the boy and sends him away. One night the boy stops at a castle where he finds a hidden treasure because he knows the language of the dog. The boy finds the treasure and the king adopts the boy as his own son. Eventually, the boy becomes pope. Although he doesn't know the prayers or masses, the birds sit on his shoulders and repeat to him what he should say.
