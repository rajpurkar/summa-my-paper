S'One night while walking by a lake, a drummer boy picks up a piece of linen. Later the voice of a girl asks for her shift back. She tells the drummer she is one of three daughters of a king. All three daughters have been placed under a curse. They live on glass mountain but must come to the lake to bathe. She cannot return to the mountain unless she has her shift. The boy gives it back to her then promises to rescue her. When he gets to the mountain, the boy cannot climb the slick sides. The boy sees two men fighting over a saddle, which they say will take its rider anywhere he wishes to be. The boy tricks the men into running away from the saddle then jumps onto it himself and wishes himself on top of the mountain.'

S"A young drummer went out quite alone one evening into the country,\nand came to a lake on the shore of which he perceived lying there\nthree pieces of white linen.  What fine linen, said he, and put one\npiece in his pocket.  He returned home, thought no more of what he\nhad found, and went to bed.  Just as he was going to sleep, it\nseemed to him as if someone was calling his name.  He listened,\nand was aware of a soft voice which cried to him, drummer, drummer,\nwake up.  As it was a dark night he could see no one, but it\nappeared to him that a figure was hovering about his bed.  What\ndo you want, he asked.  Give me back my shift, answered the voice,\nthat you took away from me last evening by the lake.  You shall have\nit back again, said the drummer, if you will tell me who you are.\nAh, replied the voice, I am the daughter of a mighty king.  But I\nhave fallen into the power of a witch, and am shut up on the\nglass-mountain.  I have to bathe in the lake every day with my\ntwo sisters, but I cannot fly back again without my shift.  My\nsisters have gone away, but I have been forced to stay behind.  I\nentreat you to give me my shift back.  Don't worry, poor child,\nsaid the drummer.  I will willingly give it back to you.  He took\nit out of his pocket, and reached it to her in the dark.  She\nsnatched it in haste, and wanted to go away with it.  Stop a\nmoment, perhaps I can help you.  You can only help me by ascending\nthe glass-mountain, and indeed if you were quite close to it you\ncould not ascend it.  When I want to do a thing I always can do\nit, said the drummer.  I am sorry for you, and have no fear of\nanything.  But I do not know the way which leads to the\nglass-mountain.  The road goes through the great\nforest, in which the man-eaters live, she answered, and more than\nthat, I dare not tell you.  And then he heard her wings as she flew\naway.\nBy daybreak the drummer arose, buckled on his drums, and went\nwithout fear straight into the forest.  After he had walked for\na while without seeing any giants, he thought to himself, I\nmust waken up the sluggards, and he hung his drum before him,\nand beat such a roll that the birds flew out of the trees with\nloud cries.  It was not long before a giant who had been lying\nsleeping among the grass, rose up, and was as tall as a fir-tree.\nWretch, cried he, what are you drumming here for, and wakening\nme out of my best sleep.  I am drumming, he replied, because\nI want to show the way to many thousands who are following me.\nWhat do they want in my forest, demanded the giant.  They want\nto put an end to you, and cleanse the forest of such a monster\nas you.  Oho.  Said the giant, I will trample you all to death\nlike so many ants.  Do you think you can do anything against us,\nsaid the drummer, if you stoop to take hold of one, he will jump\naway and hide himself.  But when you are lying down and sleeping,\nthey will come forth from every thicket, and creep up to you.\nEvery one of them has a hammer of steel in his belt, and with\nthat they will beat in your skull.  The giant grew angry and\nthought, if I meddle with the crafty folk, it might turn out\nbadly for me.  I can strangle wolves and bears, but I cannot\nprotect myself from these earth-worms.  Listen, little fellow,\nsaid he, go back again, and I will promise you that for the\nfuture I will leave you and your comrades in peace, and if there\nis anything else you wish for, tell me, for I am quite willing\nto do something to please you.  You have long legs, said\nthe drummer, and can run quicker than I.  Carry me to the\nglass-mountain, and I will give my followers a signal to go\nback, and they shall leave you in peace this time.  Come here,\nworm, said the giant.  Seat yourself on my shoulder, I will carry\nyou where you wish to be.  The giant lifted him up, and the\ndrummer began to beat his drum up aloft to his heart's delight.\nThe giant thought, that is the signal for the other people to\nturn back.\nAfter a while, a second giant was standing in the road, who took\nthe drummer from the first, and stuck him in his button-hole.\nThe drummer laid hold of the button, which was as large as a\ndish, held on by it, and looked merrily around.  Then they came\nto a third giant, who took him out of the button-hole, and set\nhim on the rim of his hat.  Up there the drummer walked backwards\nand forwards, and looked over the trees, and when he perceived\na mountain in the blue distance, he thought, that must be the\nglass-mountain, and so it was.  The giant only made two more\nsteps, and they reached the foot of the mountain, where the\ngiant put him down.  The drummer demanded to be put on the\nsummit of the glass-mountain, but the giant shook his head,\ngrowled something in his beard, and went back into the forest.\nAnd now the poor drummer was standing before the mountain, which\nwas as high as if three mountains were piled on each other, and\nat the same time as smooth as a looking-glass, and did not know\nhow to get up it.  He began to climb, but that was useless, for\nhe always slipped back again.  If one was a bird now, thought\nhe.  But what was the good of wishing, no wings grew for him.\nWhilst he was standing thus, not knowing what to do, he saw, not\nfar from him, two men who were struggling fiercely together.  He\nwent up to them and saw that they were disputing about a saddle\nwhich was lying on the ground before them, and which both of them\nwanted to have.  What fools you are, said he, to quarrel about\na saddle, when you have not a horse for it.  The saddle is\nworth fighting about, answered one of the men.  Whosoever\nsits on it, and wishes himself in any place, even if it should\nbe the very end of the earth, gets there the instant he has uttered\nthe wish.  The saddle belongs to us in common.  It is my turn\nto ride on it, but that other man will not let me do it.  I\nwill soon decide the quarrel, said the drummer, and he went\nto a short distance and stuck a white rod in the ground.  Then\nhe came back and said, now run to the goal, and whoever gets\nthere first, shall ride first.  Both set out at a trot, but\nhardly had they gone a couple of steps before the drummer swung\nhimself on the saddle, wished himself on the glass-mountain\nand before any one could turn round, he was there.  On the\ntop of the mountain was a plain.  There stood an old stone house,\nand in front of the house lay a great fish-pond, but behind it was\na dark forest.  He saw neither men nor animals, everything was\nquiet.  Only the wind rustled amongst the trees, and the clouds\nmoved by quite close above his head.  He went to the door and\nknocked.  When he had knocked for the third time, an old woman\nwith a brown face and red eyes opened the door.  She had\nspectacles on her long nose, and looked sharply at him.  Then\nshe asked what he wanted.  Entrance, food, and a bed for the\nnight, replied the drummer.  That you shall have, said the old\nwoman, if you will perform three services in return.  Why not,\nhe answered, I am not afraid of any kind of work, however, hard\nit may be.  The old woman let him go in, and gave him some food\nand a good bed at night.  The next morning when he had slept\nhis fill, she took a thimble from her wrinkled finger, reached\nit to the drummer, and said, go to work now, and empty out the\npond with this thimble.  But you must have done it before night,\nand must have sought out all the fishes which are in the water\nand laid them side by side, according to their kind and size.\nThat is strange work, said the drummer, but he went to the pond,\nand began to empty it.  He baled the whole morning.  But what\ncan anyone do to a great lake with a thimble, even if he were\nto bale for a thousand years.\nWhen it was noon, he thought, it is all useless, and whether I\nwork or not it will come to the same thing.  So he gave it up\nand sat down.  Then came a maiden out of the house who set a\nlittle basket with food before him, and said, what ails you,\nthat you sit so sadly here.  He looked at her, and saw that\nshe was wondrously beautiful.  Ah, said he, I cannot finish\nthe first piece of work, how will it be with the others.  I\ncame forth to seek a king's daughter who is said to dwell here,\nbut I have not found her, and I will go farther.  Stay here,\nsaid the maiden, I will help you out of your difficulty.  You\nare tired, lay your head in my lap, and sleep.  When you awake\nagain, your work will be done.  The drummer did not\nneed to be told that twice.  As soon as his eyes were shut,\nshe turned a wishing-ring and said, rise, water.  Fishes, come out.\nInstantly the water rose on high like a white mist, and moved\naway with the other clouds, and the fishes sprang on the shore\nand laid themselves side by side each according to his size and\nkind.  When the drummer awoke, he saw with amazement that all\nwas done.  But the maiden said, one of the fish is not lying\nwith those of its own kind, but quite alone.  When the old\nwoman comes to-night and sees that all she demanded has been\ndone, she will ask you, what is this fish lying alone for.\nThen throw the fish in her face, and say, this one shall be\nfor you, old witch.  In the evening the witch came, and when\nshe had put this question, he threw the fish in her face.  She\nbehaved as if she did not notice it, and said nothing, but\nlooked at him with malicious eyes.  Next morning she said,\nyesterday it was too easy for you, I must give you harder work.\nTo-day you must hew down the whole of the forest, split the wood\ninto logs, and pile them up, and everything must be finished\nby the evening.  She gave him an axe, a mallet, and two wedges.\nBut the axe was made of lead, and the mallet and wedges were of\ntin.  When he began to cut, the edge of the axe was blunted,\nand the mallet and wedges were beaten out of shape.  He did\nnot know how to manage, but at mid-day the maiden came once more\nwith his dinner and comforted him.  Lay your head on my lap,\nsaid she, and sleep.  When you awake, your work will be done.\nShe turned her wishing-ring, and in an instant the whole forest\nfell down with a crash, the wood split, and arranged itself\nin heaps, and it seemed just as if unseen giants were finishing\nthe work.  When he awoke, the maiden said, do you see that the\nwood is piled up and arranged, one bough alone remains.  But\nwhen the old woman comes this evening and asks you about that\nbough, give her a blow with it, and say, that is for you,\nyou witch.\nThe old woman came, there you see how easy the work was,\nsaid she.  But for whom have you left that bough.  For you,\nyou witch, he replied, and gave her a blow with it.  But she\npretended not to feel it, laughed scornfully, and said, early\nto-morrow morning you shall arrange all the wood in one heap,\nset fire to it, and burn it.  He rose at break of day, and began\nto pick up the wood, but how can a single man get a whole forest\ntogether.  The work made no progress.  The maiden, however,\ndid not desert him in his need.  She brought him his food at\nnoon, and when he had eaten, he laid his head on her lap, and\nwent to sleep.  When he awoke, the entire pile of wood was\nburning in one enormous flame, which stretched its tongues\nout into the sky.  Listen to me, said the maiden, when the witch\ncomes, she will give you all kinds of orders.  Do whatever she\nasks you without fear, and then she will not be able to get the\nbetter of you, but if you are afraid, the fire will lay hold\nof you, and consume you.  At last when you have done everything,\nseize her with both your hands, and throw her into the midst\nof the fire.  The maiden departed, and the old woman came\nsneaking up to him.  Oh, I am cold, said she, but that is a fire\nthat burns.  It warms my old bones, and does me good.  But I\nsee a log lying there which won't burn, bring it out for me.\nWhen you have done that, you are free, and may go where you\nlike.  Now, jump in.\nThe drummer did not reflect long.  He sprang into the midst of\nthe flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe\na hair of his head.  He carried the log out, and laid it\ndown.  Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was\ntransformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his\nneed stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden\ngarments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the\nking's daughter.  But the old woman laughed venomously, and said,\nyou think you have her safe, but you have not got her yet.  Just\nas she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the\nyouth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up\non high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed\nover her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be\nburnt.\nThen the king's daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw\nthat he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked\nhis life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said, you\nhave ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything\nfor yours.  Promise to be true to me, and you shall be my\nhusband.  We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough\nwith what the witch has gathered together here.  She led him into\nthe house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the\nold woman's treasures.  The maiden left the gold and silver where\nit was, and took only the precious stones.  She would not stay\nany longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her,\nseat yourself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like\nbirds.  I do not like the old saddle, said she, I need only\nturn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.  Very well, then,\nanswered the drummer, then wish us in front of the town-gate.  In\nthe twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said,\nI will just go to my parents and tell them the news.  Wait for\nme outside here, I shall soon be back.  Ah, said the king's\ndaughter, I beg you to be careful.  On your arrival do not kiss\nyour parents on the right cheek, or else you will forget\neverything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and\ndeserted.  How can I forget you, said he, and promised her to\ncome back very soon, and gave his hand upon it.  When he went into\nhis father's house, he had changed so much that no one knew who\nhe was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain\nhad been three years.  Then he made himself known, and his parents\nfell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that\nhe forgot what the maiden had said and kissed them on both\ncheeks.  But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek,\nevery thought of the king's daughter vanished from him.  He\nemptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels\non the table.  The parents had not the least idea what to do with\nthe riches.  Then the father built a magnificent castle all\nsurrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a prince were\ngoing to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said, I\nhave found a maiden for you and the wedding shall be in three days.\nThe son was content to do as his parents desired.\nThe poor king's daughter had stood for a long time outside the\ntown waiting for the return of the young man.  When evening came,\nshe said, he must certainly have kissed his parents on the right\ncheek, and has forgotten me.  Her heart was full of sorrow, she\nwished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would\nnot return to her father's court.  Every evening she went into\nthe town and passed the young man's house.  He often saw her,\nbut he no longer knew her.  At length she heard the people\nsaying, the wedding will take place to-morrow.  Then she said,\nI will try if I can win back his heart.\nOn the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her\nwishing-ring, and said, a dress as bright as the sun.  Instantly\nthe dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been\nwoven of real sunbeams.  When all the guests were assembled, she\nentered the hall.  Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress,\nand the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the\nthings she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked\nif she would sell it to her.  Not for money, she answered, but\nif I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where\nyour betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.  The bride\ncould not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a\nsleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night,\nwhich made him fall into a deep sleep.  When all had be-\n           - line missing in book copy -\nof the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,\n          drummer, drummer, I pray you hear.\n          Have you forgotten you held me dear.\n          That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour.\n          That I rescued your life from the witch's power.\n          Did you not plight your troth to me.\n          Drummer, drummer, hearken to me.\nBut it was all in vain, for the drummer did not awake, and when\nmorning dawned, the king's daughter was forced to go back again\nas she came.  On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring\nand said, a dress as silvery as the moon.  When she appeared at\nthe feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again\nexcited the desire of the bride, and the king's daughter gave it\nto her\nfor permission to pass the second night also, outside the door\nof the bedroom.  When in the stillness of the night, she cried,\n          drummer, drummer, I pray you hear.\n          Have you forgotten you held me dear.\n          That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour.\n          That I rescued your life from the witch's power.\n          Did you not plight your troth to me.\n          Drummer, drummer, hearken to me.\nBut the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught,\ncould not be aroused.  Sadly next morning she went back to\nher hut in the forest.  But the people in the house had heard\nthe lamentation of the unknown maiden, and told the bridegroom\nabout it.  They told him also that it was impossible that he could\nhear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry\nhad poured a sleeping-draught into his wine.\nOn the third evening, the king's daughter turned her wishing-ring,\nand said, a dress glittering like the stars.  When she showed\nherself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself\nwith the splendor of the dress, which far surpassed the others,\nand she said, I must, and will have it.  The maiden gave it as\nshe had given the others for permission to spend the night\noutside the bridegroom's door.  The bridegroom, however, did not\ndrink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed,\nbut poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he\nheard a sweet voice which called to him,\n          drummer, drummer, I pray you hear.\n          Have you forgotten you held me dear.\n          That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour.\n          That I rescued your life from the witch's power.\n          Did you not plight your troth to me.\n          Drummer, drummer, hearken to me.\nSuddenly his memory returned to him.  Ah, cried he, how can I\nhave acted so unfaithfully.  But the kiss which in the joy of my\nheart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame\nfor it all.  That is what stupefied me.  He sprang up, took the\nking's daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents, bed.\nThis is my true bride, said he.  If I marry the other, I shall\ndo a great wrong.  The parents, when they heard how everything\nhad happened, gave their consent.  Then the lights in the\nhall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought,\nfriends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding\nwas solemnized with great rejoicing.  The first bride received\nthe beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself\nsatisfied.\n"
