One night while walking by a lake, a drummer boy picks up a piece of linen. Later the voice of a girl asks for her shift back. She tells the drummer she is one of three daughters of a king. All three daughters have been placed under a curse. They live on glass mountain but must come to the lake to bathe. She cannot return to the mountain unless she has her shift. The boy gives it back to her then promises to rescue her. When he gets to the mountain, the boy cannot climb the slick sides. The boy sees two men fighting over a saddle, which they say will take its rider anywhere he wishes to be. The boy tricks the men into running away from the saddle then jumps onto it himself and wishes himself on top of the mountain.
