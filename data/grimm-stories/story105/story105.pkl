S"\tRumpelstiltskin\n\nOnce there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful\ndaughter.  Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the\nking, and in order to make himself appear important he said\nto him, I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold.  The\nking said to the miller, that is an art which\npleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring\nher to-morrow to my palace, and I will put her to the test.\n\nAnd when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room\nwhich was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a\nreel, and said, now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning\nearly you have not spun this straw into gold during the night,\nyou must die.  Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and\nleft her in it alone.  So there sat the poor miller's daughter,\nand for the life of her could not tell what to do, she had no\nidea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and\nmore frightened, until at last she began to weep.\n\nBut all at once the door opened, and in came a little man,\nand said, good evening, mistress miller, why are you crying so.\nAlas, answered the girl, I have to spin straw into gold, and I do\nnot know how to do it.  What will you give me, said the\nmanikin, if I do it for you.  My necklace, said the girl.  The\nlittle man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the\nwheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was\nfull, then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times\nround, and the second was full too.  And so it went on until\nthe morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels\nwere full of gold.\n\nBy daybreak the king was already there, and\nwhen he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his\nheart became only more greedy.  He had the miller's daughter\ntaken into another room full of straw, which was much larger,\nand commanded her to spin that also in one night if she valued\nher life.  The girl knew not how to help herself, and was\ncrying, when the door opened again, and the little man appeared,\nand said, what will you give me if I spin that straw into gold\nfor you.  The ring on my finger, answered the girl.  The little\nman took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and by\nmorning had spun all the straw into glittering gold.\n\nThe king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had\nnot gold enough, and he had the miller's daughter taken into\na still larger room full of straw, and said, you must spin this,\ntoo, in the course of this night, but if you succeed, you shall\nbe my wife.\n\nEven if she be a miller's daughter, thought he, I could not\nfind a richer wife in the whole world.\n\nWhen the girl was alone the manikin came again for the third\ntime, and said, what will you give me if I spin the straw for\nyou this time also.  I have nothing left that I could give,\nanswered the girl.  Then promise me, if you should become queen,\nto give me your first child.  Who knows whether that will\never happen, thought the miller's daughter, and, not knowing\nhow else to help herself in this strait, she promised the\nmanikin what he wanted, and for that he once more spun the\nstraw into gold.\n\nAnd when the king came in the morning, and found all as he\nhad wished, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller's\ndaughter became a queen.\n\nA year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world,\nand she never gave a thought to the manikin.  But suddenly he\ncame into her room, and said, now give me what you promised.\n\nThe queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the\nriches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child.  But the\nmanikin said, no, something alive is dearer to me than all the\ntreasures in the world.  Then the queen began to lament and cry,\nso that the manikin pitied her.  I will give you three days,\ntime, said he, if by that time you find out my name, then shall\nyou keep your child.\n\nSo the queen thought the whole night of all the names that\nshe had ever heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to\ninquire, far and wide, for any other names that there might be.\nWhen the manikin came the next day, she began with caspar,\nmelchior, balthazar, and said all the names she knew, one\nafter another, but to every one the little man said, that is not\nmy name.  On the second day she had inquiries made in the\nneighborhood as to the names of the people there, and she\nrepeated to the manikin the most uncommon and curious.  Perhaps\nyour name is shortribs, or sheepshanks, or laceleg, but he\nalways answered, that is not my name.\n\nOn the third day the messenger came back again, and said, I\nhave not been able to find a single new name, but as I came to\na high mountain at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare\nbid each other good night, there I saw a little house, and\nbefore the house a fire was burning, and round about the fire\nquite a ridiculous little man was jumping, he hopped upon\none leg, and shouted -\n          to-day I bake, to-morrow brew,\n          the next I'll have the young queen's child.\n          Ha, glad am I that no one knew\n          that Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.\n\nYou may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the\nname.  And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and\nasked, now, mistress queen, what is my name, at first she\nsaid, is your name Conrad?  No.  Is your name Harry?  No.\nPerhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?\n\nThe devil has told you that!  The devil has told you that, cried\nthe little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so\ndeep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in\nrage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that\nhe tore himself in two.\n"
