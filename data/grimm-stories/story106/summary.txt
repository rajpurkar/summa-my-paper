A lame tailor seeks entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Peter instructs the tailor to sit quietly. Instead of following orders, the tailor looks about heaven and cannot resist the urge to sit in the Lord's seat. From this seat the tailor can see everything on earth, including a old woman in the act of stealing two veils. In his anger the tailor throws down the Lord's golden footstool. The tailor goes back behind the door. The Lord asks Peter what has happened to his footstool. The tailor admits he threw the footstool. The Lord tells the tailor the no one has the right to judge except the Lord Himself. If He acted the way the tailor had, the Lord says, there would be no furniture at all in heaven. The Lord banishes the tailor from heaven.
