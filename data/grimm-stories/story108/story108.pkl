S'Seven Swabians set out on an adventure. They carry one spear, a weapon so long it takes all seven to hold it. In their first adventure, the Swabians are scared by a hornet and surrender to a garden rake. Once they realize they have been silly, the seven agree not to speak of the incident. Next, they encounter a hare, which they believe to be a dragon. The seven attack and are happy when their "enemy" runs away from them. Next the men come to a river they want to cross. They all drown when they try to wade across this deep, rough river.'

S"Seven swabians were once together.  The first was master\nschulz, the second, jackli, the third, marli, the fourth,\njergli, the fifth, michal, the sixth, Hans, the seventh,\nveitli.  All seven had made up their minds to travel\nabout the world to seek adventures and perform great\ndeeds.  But in order that they might go in safety and with\narms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable\nthat they should have one solitary, but very strong,\nand very long spear made for them.  This spear all seven of\nthem took in their hands at once.  In front walked the\nboldest and bravest,\nand that was master schulz.  All the others followed in a\nrow, and veitli was the last.  Then it came to pass one\nday in the hay month, when they had walked a long distance,\nand still had a long way to go before they reached the\nvillage where they were to pass the night, that as they\nwere in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet\nflew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing\nmanner.  Master schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped\nthe spear, and a cold sweat broke out over his whole body.\nHark, hark, cried he to his comrades, good heavens.  I hear a\ndrum.  Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and into\nwhose nose some smell had risen, said, something is most\ncertainly going on, for I smell the powder and the match.  At\nthese words master schulz began to take to flight, and in a\ntrice jumped\nover a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of\na rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the\nhandle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous\nblow.  O dear.  O dear, screamed master schulz.  Take me\nprisoner, I surrender, I surrender.  The other six all leapt\nover, one on the top of the other, crying, if you surrender, I\nsurrender too.  If you surrender, I surrender too.  At length,\nas no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that\nthey had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not\nbe known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they\nall swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one\nof them should speak of it by mistake.\nThen they journeyed onwards.  The second danger which they\nsurvived cannot be compared with the first.  Some days afterwards,\ntheir path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting\nsleeping in the sun.  Her ears were standing straight up, and her\ngreat glassy eyes were wide open.  All of them were alarmed at\nthe sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together\nas to what it would be the least dangerous to do.  For if they\nwere to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and\nswallow them whole.  So they said, we must go through a great\nand dangerous struggle.  Boldly ventured, is half won, and all\nseven grasped the spear, master schulz in front, and veitli\nbehind.  Master schulz was always trying to keep the spear\nback, but veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted\nto dash forward and cried,\n          strike home, in every swabian's name,\n          or else I wish you may be lame.\nBut Hans knew how to meet this, and said,\n          thunder and lightning, it's fine to prate,\n          but for dragon-hunting you are always late.\nMichal cried,\n          nothing is missing, not even a hair,\n          be sure the devil himself is there.\nThen it was jergli's turn, and he said,\n          if it be not he, it's at least his mother,\n          or else the devil's own step-brother.\nAnd now marli had a bright thought, and said to veitli,\n          advance, veitli, advance, advance,\n          and I behind will hold the lance.\nVeitli, however, did not obey, and jackli said,\n          tis schulz's place the first to be,\n          no one deserves that honor but he.\nThen master schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,\n          then let us boldly advance to the fight,\n          thus we shall show our valor and might.\nHereupon they all together set on the dragon.  Master\nschulz crossed himself and prayed for God's assistance, but\nas all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer\nto the enemy, he screamed, oho, oho, ho, ho, ho, in the greatest\nanguish.  This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted\nswiftly away.  When master schulz saw her thus flying from the\nfield of battle, he cried in his joy,\n          quick, veitli, quick, look there, look there,\n          the monster's nothing but a hare.\nBut the swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and\ncame to the moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are\nfew bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in\nboats.  As the seven swabians did not know this, they called\nto a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to\nknow how people contrived to get across.  The distance and their\nway of speaking made the man unable to understand what they\nwanted, and he said, what, what, in the way people speak in\nthe neighborhood of treves.  Master schulz thought he was saying,\nwade, wade through the water, and as he was the first, began\nto set out and\nwent into the moselle.  It was not long before he sank in the\nmud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was\nblown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down\nbeside it, and croaked, wat, wat, wat.  The other six on the\nopposite side heard that, and said, oho, comrades, master\nschulz is calling us.  If he can wade across, why cannot we.\nSo they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and\nwere drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of\nthem, and not one of the swabian allies ever reached home again.\n"
