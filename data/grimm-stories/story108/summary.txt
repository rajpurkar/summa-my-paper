Seven Swabians set out on an adventure. They carry one spear, a weapon so long it takes all seven to hold it. In their first adventure, the Swabians are scared by a hornet and surrender to a garden rake. Once they realize they have been silly, the seven agree not to speak of the incident. Next, they encounter a hare, which they believe to be a dragon. The seven attack and are happy when their "enemy" runs away from them. Next the men come to a river they want to cross. They all drown when they try to wade across this deep, rough river.
