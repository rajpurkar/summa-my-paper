S"There was once upon a time a king, but where he reigned and what\nhe was called, I do not know.  He had no son, but an only daughter\nwho had always been ill, and no doctor had been able to cure her.\nThen it was foretold to the king that his daughter would find her\nhealth by eating an apple.  So he ordered it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the whole of his kingdom, that whosoever brought his\ndaughter an apple with which she could find her health, should\nhave her to wife, and be king.  This became known to a peasant\nwho had three sons, and he said to the eldest, go out into the\ngarden and take a basketful of those beautiful apples with\nthe red cheeks and carry them to the court, perhaps the king's\ndaughter will be able to find her health with them, and then you\nwill marry her and be king.  The lad did so, and set out.  When\nhe had gone a short way he met a hoary little man who asked him\nwhat he had there in the basket, to which replied uele for so was\nhe named, frogs, legs.  At this the little man said, well, so\nshall it be, and remain, and went away.  At length uele arrived at\nthe palace, and made it known that he had brought apples which\nwould cure the king's daughter if she ate them.  This delighted the\nking hugely, and he caused uele to be brought before him, but,\nalas.  When he opened the basket, instead of having apples in it he\nhad frogs, legs which were still kicking about.  On this the king\ngrew angry, and had him driven out of the house.  When he got home\nhe told his father how it had fared with him.  Then the father\nsent the next son, who was called same, but all went with him just\nas it had gone with uele.  He also met the hoary little man,\nwho asked what he had there in the basket.  Same said, hogs,\nbristles, and the hoary man said, well, so shall it be, and remain.\nWhen same got to the king's palace and said he brought apples with\nwhich the king's daughter might find her health, they did not\nwant to let him go in, and said that one fellow had already been\nthere, and had treated them as if they were fools.  Same, however,\nmaintained that he certainly had the apples, and that they ought\nto let him go in.  At length they believed him, and led him to the\nking.  But when he uncovered the basket, he had but hogs, bristles.\nThis enraged the king most terribly, so he caused same to be whipped\nout of the house.  When he got home he related all that had befallen\nhim, whereupon the youngest boy, whose name was Hans, but who was\nalways called stupid Hans, came and asked his father if he might\ngo with some apples.  Oh, said the father, you would be just the\nright fellow for such a thing.  If the clever one can't manage it,\nwhat can you do.  The boy, however, insisted and said, indeed,\nfather, I wish to go.  Just get away, you stupid fellow, you must\nwait till you are wiser, said the father to that, and turned his\nback.  Hans, however, pulled at the back of his smock and\nsaid, indeed, father, I wish to go.  Well, then, so far as I am\nconcerned you may go, but you will soon come home again, replied\nthe old man in a spiteful voice.  The boy was tremendously delighted\nand jumped for joy.  Well, act like a fool.  You grow more stupid\nevery day, said the father again.  But Hans was not discouraged, and\ndid not let it spoil his pleasure, but as it was then night, he\nthought he might as well wait until the morrow, for he could\nnot get to court that day.  All night long he could not sleep in his\nbed, and if he did doze for a moment, he dreamt of beautiful\nmaidens, of palaces, of gold, and of silver, and all kinds of things\nof that sort.  Early in the morning, he went forth on his way, and\ndirectly afterwards the little shabby-looking man in his icy\nclothes, came to him and asked what he was carrying in the basket.\nHans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the\nking's daughter was to find her health.  Then, said the little man,\nso shall they be, and remain.  But at the court they would none of\nthem let Hans go in, for they said two had already been there who\nhad told them that they were bringing apples, and one of them had\nfrogs, legs, and the other hogs, bristles.  Hans, however,\nresolutely maintained that he most certainly had no frogs, legs,\nbut some of the most beautiful apples in the whole kingdom.  As he\nspoke so pleasantly, the door-keeper thought he could not be\ntelling a lie, and asked him to go in, and he was right, for when\nHans uncovered his basket in the king's presence, golden-yellow\napples came tumbling out.  The king was delighted, and caused some\nof them to be\ntaken to his daughter, and then waited in anxious expectation until\nnews should be brought to him of the effect they had.  But\nbefore much time had passed by, news was brought to him.  And who\ndo you think it was who came.  It was the daughter herself.  As\nsoon as she had eaten of those apples, she was cured, and sprang\nout of her bed.  The joy the king felt cannot be described.  But\nnow he did not want to give his daughter in marriage to Hans, and\nsaid he must first make him a boat which would go quicker on dry\nland than on water.  Hans agreed to the condition, and went home,\nand related how it had fared with him.  Then the father sent\nuele into\nthe forest to make a boat of that kind.  He worked diligently,\nand whistled all the time.  At mid-day, when the sun was at\nits highest, came the little icy man and asked what he was making.\nUele gave him for answer, wooden bowls for the kitchen.  The\nicy man said, so it shall be, and remain.  By evening uele\nthought he had now made the boat, but when he wanted to get\ninto it, he had nothing but wooden bowls.  The next day same\nwent into the forest, but everything went with him just as it\nhad done with uele.  On the third day stupid Hans went.  He worked\naway most industriously, so that the whole forest resounded\nwith the heavy blows, and all the while he sang and whistled\nright merrily.  At mid-day, when it was the hottest, the little\nman came again, and asked what he was making.  A boat which will\ngo quicker on dry land than on water, replied Hans, and when\nI have finished it, I am to have the king's daughter for my wife.\nWell, said the little man, such an one shall it be, and remain.\nIn the evening, when the sun had turned into gold, Hans finished\nhis boat, and all that was wanted for it.  He got into it and\nrowed to the palace.  The boat went as swiftly as the wind.  The\nking saw it from afar, but would not give his daughter to Hans\nyet, and said he must first take a hundred hares out to pasture\nfrom early morning until late evening, and if one of them got\naway, he should not have his daughter.  Hans was contented\nwith this, and the next day went with his flock to the pasture,\nand took great care that none of them ran away.\nBefore many hours had passed came a servant from the palace, and\ntold Hans that he must give her a hare instantly, for some\nvisitors had come unexpectedly.  Hans, however, was very well\naware what that meant, and said he would not give her one.  The\nking might set some hare soup before his guest next day.  The\nmaid, however, would not accept his refusal, and at last she\nbegan to argue with him.  Then Hans said that if the king's\ndaughter came herself, he would give her a fare.  The maid told\nthis in the palace, and the daughter did go herself.  In the\nmeantime the little man came again to Hans, and asked him what he\nwas doing there.  He said he had to watch over a hundred hares\nand see that none of them ran away,\nand then he might marry the king's daughter and be king.  Good,\nsaid the little man, there is a whistle for you, and if one of\nthem runs away, just whistle with it, and then it will come\nback again.  When the king's daughter came, Hans gave her a\nhare into her apron, but when she had gone about a hundred steps\nwith it, he whistled, and the hare jumped out of the apron,\nand before she could turn round was back to the flock again.\nWhen the evening came the hare-herd whistled once more, and\nlooked to see if all were there, and then drove them to the\npalace.  The king wondered how Hans had been able to take a\nhundred hares to graze without losing any of them, but he still\nwould not give him his daughter yet, and said he must now\nbring him a feather from the griffin's tail.  Hans set out at\nonce, and walked straight forwards.  In the evening he came\nto a castle, and there he asked for a night's lodging, for at\nthat time there were no inns.  The lord of the castle promised\nhim that with much pleasure, and asked where he was going.  Hans\nanswered, to the griffin.  Oh, to the griffin.  They tell me\nhe knows everything, and I have lost the key of an iron money-chest.\nSo you might be so good as to ask him where it is.  Yes,\nindeed, said Hans, I will do that.  Early the next morning he\nwent onwards, and on his way arrived at another castle in which\nhe again stayed the night.  When the people who lived there\nlearnt that he was going to the griffin, they said they had\nin the house a daughter who was ill, and that they had already\ntried every means to cure her, but none of them had done her\nany good, and he might be so kind as to ask the griffin what\nwould make their daughter healthy again.  Hans said he would\nwillingly do that, and went onwards.  Then he came to a lake,\nand instead of a ferry-boat, a tall, tall man was there who\nhad to carry everybody across.  The man asked Hans whither he was\njourneying.  To the griffin, said Hans.  Then when you get to\nhim, said the man, just ask him why I am forced to carry\neverybody over the lake.  Yes, indeed, most certainly I'll do\nthat, said Hans.  Then the man took him up on his shoulders, and\ncarried him across.  At length Hans arrived at the griffin's\nhouse, but the wife only was at home, and not the griffin\nhimself.  Then the woman asked him what he wanted.  Thereupon he\ntold her everything - that he had to get a feather out of the\ngriffin's tail, and that there was a castle where they had lost\nthe key of their money-chest, and he was to ask the griffin where\nit was - that in another castle the daughter was ill, and\nhe was to learn what would cure her - and then not far from thence\nthere was a lake and a man beside it, who was forced to carry\npeople across it, and he was very anxious to learn why the man\nwas obliged to do it.  Then said the woman, look here, my good\nfriend, no christian can speak to the griffin.  He devours them\nall, but if you like you can lie down under his bed, and in the\nnight, when he is quite fast asleep, you can reach out and pull\na feather out of his tail, and as for those things which you\nare to learn, I will ask about them myself.  Hans was quite\nsatisfied with\nthis, and got under the bed.  In the evening, the griffin came\nhome, and as soon as he entered the room, said, wife, I smell\na christian.  Yes, said the woman, one was here to-day, but he\nwent away again.  And on that the griffin said no more.\nIn the middle of the night when the griffin was snoring loudly,\nHans reached out and plucked a feather from his tail.  The\ngriffin woke up instantly, and said, wife, I smell a christian,\nand it seems to me that somebody was pulling at my tail.  His\nwife said, you have certainly been dreaming, and I told you\nbefore that a christian was here to-day, but that he went away\nagain.  He told me all kinds of things - that in one castle they\nhad lost the key of their money-chest, and could find it nowhere.\nOh.  The fools, said the griffin.  The key lies in the wood-house\nunder a log of wood behind the door.  And then he said that in\nanother castle the daughter was ill, and they knew no remedy\nthat would cure her.  Oh.  The fools, said the griffin.  Under\nthe cellar-steps a toad has made its nest of her hair, and if\nshe got her hair back she would be well.  And then he also\nsaid that there was a place where there was a lake and a man\nbeside it who was forced to carry everybody across.  Oh, the\nfool, said the griffin.  If he only put one man down in the\nmiddle, he would never have to carry another across.  Early the\nnext morning the griffin got up and went out.  Then Hans\ncame forth from under the bed, and he had a beautiful feather,\nand had heard what the griffin had said about the key, and\nthe daughter, and the man.  The griffin's wife repeated it all\nonce more to him that he might not forget it, and then he went\nhome again.  First he came to the man by the lake, who asked\nhim what the griffin had said, but Hans replied that he must\nfirst carry him across, and then he would tell him.  So the man\ncarried him across, and when he was over Hans told him that all\nhe had to do was to set one person down in the middle of the\nlake, and then he would never have to carry over any more.  The\nman was hugely delighted, and told Hans that out of gratitude he\nwould take him once more across, and back again.  But Hans said\nno, he would save him the trouble, he was quite satisfied\nalready, and pursued his way.  Then he came to the\ncastle where the daughter was ill.  He took her on his shoulders,\nfor she could not walk, and carried her down the cellar-steps and\npulled out the toad's nest from beneath the lowest step and gave\nit into her hand, and she sprang off his shoulder and up the\nsteps before him, and was quite cured.  Then were the father and\nmother beyond measure rejoiced, and they gave Hans gifts of gold\nand of silver, and whatsoever else he wished for, that they\ngave him.  And when he got to the other castle he went at once\ninto the wood-house, and found the key under the log of wood\nbehind the door, and took it to the lord of the castle.  He\nwas not a little pleased, and gave Hans as a reward much of the\ngold that was in the chest, and all kinds of things besides,\nsuch as cows, and sheep, and goats.  When Hans arrived before\nthe king, with all these things - with the money, and the gold,\nand the silver and the cows, sheep and goats, the king asked\nhim how he had come by them.  Then Hans told him that the\ngriffin gave every one whatsoever he wanted.  So the king thought\nhe himself could make use of such things, and set out on his way\nto the griffin, but when he got to the lake, it happened that\nhe was the very first who arrived there after Hans, and the man\nput him down in the middle of it and went away, and the king\nwas drowned.  Hans, however, married the daughter, and became\nking.\n"
