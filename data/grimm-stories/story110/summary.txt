A peasant and a rich man die and go to heaven at the same time. St. Peter lets the rich man in but seems to overlook the peasant. While waiting outside the gates, the peasant hears much singing and rejoicing at the rich man's entrance into heaven. When St. Peter opens the gates again, he sees the peasant and lets him in. The peasant is welcomed warmly but there is no singing or rejoicing. The peasant assumes heaven is no different than earth, with the rich preferred over the poor. St. Peter tells him the rejoicing was because peasants were admitted every day while rich people came only rarely.
