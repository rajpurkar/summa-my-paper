S'There was a great war, and the king had many soldiers, but gave them\nsmall pay, so small that they could not live upon it, so three of\nthem agreed among themselves to desert.  One of them said to the\nothers, "If we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows, how\nshall we manage it?" Another said, "Look at that great cornfield, if\nwe were to hide ourselves there, no one could find us, the troops are\nnot allowed to enter it, and to-morrow they are to march away." They\ncrept into the corn, only the troops did not march away, but remained\nlying all round about it.  They stayed in the corn for two days and\ntwo nights, and were so hungry that they all but died, but if they\nhad come out, their death would have been certain.  Then said they,\n"What is the use of our deserting if we have to perish miserably\nhere?"\n\nBut now a fiery dragon came flying through the air, and it came down\nto them, and asked why they had concealed themselves there.  They\nanswered, "We are three soldiers who have deserted because the pay\nwas so bad, and now we shall have to die of hunger if we stay here,\nor to dangle on the gallows if we go out." "If you will serve me for\nseven years," said the dragon, "I will convey you through the army so\nthat no one shall seize you." "We have no choice and are compelled to\naccept," they replied.  Then the dragon caught hold of them with his\nclaws, and carried them away through the air over the army, and put\nthem down again on the earth far from it, but the dragon was no other\nthan the devil.  He gave them a small whip and said, "Whip with it\nand crack it, and then as much gold will spring up round about as you\ncan wish for, then you can live like great lords, keep horses, and\ndrive your carriages, but when the seven years have come to an end,\nyou are my property."\n\nThen he put before them a book which they were all three forced to\nsign.  "But first I will ask you a riddle," said he, "and if you can\nguess it, you shall be free, and released from my power." Then the\ndragon flew away from them, and they went away with their whip, had\ngold in plenty, ordered themselves rich apparel, and traveled about\nthe world.  Wherever they were they lived in pleasure and\nmagnificence, rode on horseback, drove in carriages, ate and drank,\nbut did nothing wicked.  The time slipped quickly by, and when the\nseven years were coming to an end, two of them were terribly anxious\nand alarmed, but the third took the affair easily, and said,\n"Brothers, fear nothing, I still have my wits about me, I shall guess\nthe riddle." They went out into the open country and sat down, and\nthe two pulled sorrowful faces.  Then an aged woman came up to them\nwho inquired why they were so sad. "Well," said they, "what has that\ngot to do with you?  After all, you cannot help us." "Who knows?"\nsaid she. "Just confide your trouble to me." So they told her that\nthey had been the devil\'s servants for nearly seven years, and that\nhe had provided them with gold as though it were hay, but that they\nhad sold themselves to him, and were forfeited to him, if at the end\nof the seven years they could not guess a riddle.\n\nThe old woman said, "If you are to be saved, one of you must go into\nthe forest, there he will come to a fallen rock which looks like a\nlittle house, he must enter that, and then he will obtain help." The\ntwo melancholy ones thought to themselves, "That will still not save\nus," and stayed where they were, but the third, the merry one, got up\nand walked on in the forest until he found the rockhouse.  In the\nlittle house a very aged woman was sitting, who was the devil\'s\ngrandmother, and asked the soldier where he came from, and what he\nwanted there.  He told her everything that had happened, and as he\npleased her well, she had pity on him, and said she would help him.\nShe lifted up a great stone which lay above a cellar, and said,\n"Conceal yourself there, you can hear everything that is said here,\nonly sit still, and do not stir.  When the dragon comes, I will\nquestion him about the riddle, he tells everything to me, so listen\ncarefully to his answer."\n\nAt twelve o\'clock at night, the dragon came flying thither, and asked\nfor his dinner.  The grandmother laid the table, and served up food\nand drink, so that he was pleased, and they ate and drank together.\nIn the course of conversation, she asked him what kind of a day he\nhad had, and how many souls he had got.  "Nothing went very well\nto-day," he answered, "but I have laid hold of three soldiers, I have\nthem safe." "Indeed? Three soldiers, they\'re clever, they may escape\nyou yet." The devil said mockingly, "They are mine.  I will set them\na riddle, which they will never be able to guess." "What riddle is\nthat?" she inquired. "I will tell you, in the great north sea lies a\ndead dogfish, that shall be your roast meat, and the rib of a whale\nshall be your silver spoon, and a hollow old horse\'s hoof shall be\nyour wineglass."\n\nWhen the devil had gone to bed, the old grandmother raised up the\nstone, and let out the soldier.  "Did you give heed to everything?"\n"Yes," said he, "I know enough, and will save myself." Then he had to\ngo back another way, through the window, secretly and with all speed\nto his companions.  He told them how the devil had been outwitted by\nthe old grandmother, and how he had learned the answer to the riddle\nfrom him.  Then they were all delighted, and of good cheer, and took\nthe whip and whipped so much gold for themselves that it ran all over\nthe ground.\n\nWhen the seven years had fully gone by, the devil came with the book,\nshowed the signatures, and said, "I will take you with me to hell.\nThere you shall have a meal.  If you can guess what kind of roast\nmeat you will have to eat, you shall be free and released from your\nbargain, and may keep the whip as well." Then the first soldier began\nand said, "In the great north sea lies a dead dogfish, that no doubt\nis the roast meat."\n\nThe devil was angry, and began to mutter, "Hm. Hm. Hm." And asked the\nsecond, "But what will your spoon be?" "The rib of a whale, that is\nto be our silver spoon." The devil made a wry face, again growled,\n"Hm. Hm. Hm." He said to the third, "And do you also know what your\nwineglass is to be?" "An old horse\'s hoof is to be our wineglass."\nThen the devil flew away with a loud cry, and had no more power over\nthem, but the three kept the whip, whipped as much money for\nthemselves with it as they wanted, and lived happily to their end.\n\n'
