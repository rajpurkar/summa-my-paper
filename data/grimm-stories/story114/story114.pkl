S'A great horned owl ventures into a barn in a small village. Daylight comes and the bird is afraid to leave the barn. The owner of the barn finds the owl inside the structure and is afraid of what he calls "the beast". All the people of the village are called together. No one, not even a strong man wearing armor, is brave enough to take on the bird. Finally the villagers decide to burn the barn and thus rid themselves of the bird.'

S'Two or three hundred years ago, when people were far from being so\ncrafty and cunning as they are nowadays, an extraordinary event\ntook place in a little town.  By some mischance one of the great\nowls, called horned owls, had come from the neighboring woods into\nthe barn of one of the townsfolk in the night-time, and when day\nbroke did not dare to venture forth again from her retreat, for\nfear of the other birds, which raised a terrible outcry whenever\nshe appeared.  In the morning when the man-servant went into the\nbarn to fetch some straw, he was so mightily alarmed at the sight\nof the owl sitting there in a corner, that he ran away and\nannounced to his master that a monster, the like of which he had\nnever set eyes on in his life, and which could devour a man\nwithout the slightest difficulty, was sitting in the barn, rolling\nits eyes about in its head.  I know your kind, said the master,\nyou have courage enough to chase a blackbird about the fields, but\nwhen you see a hen lying dead, you have to get a stick before you\ngo near it.  I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster\nit is, added the master, and went quite boldly into the granary\nand looked round him.  When, however, he saw with his own eyes\nthe strange grim creature, he was no less terrified than the\nservant had been.  With two bounds he sprang out, ran to his\nneighbours, and begged them imploringly to lend him assistance\nagainst an unknown and dangerous beast, or else the whole town\nmight be in danger if it\nwere to break loose out of the barn, where it was shut up.  A\ngreat noise and clamor arose in all the streets, the townsmen\ncame armed with spears, hay-forks, scythes, and axes, as if they\nwere going out against an enemy.  Finally, the senators appeared\nwith the burgomaster at their head.  When they had drawn up in\nthe market-place, they marched to the barn, and surrounded it on\nall sides.  Thereupon one of the most courageous of them stepped\nforth and entered with his spear lowered, but came running out\nimmediately afterwards with a shriek and as pale as death, and\ncould not utter a single word.  Yet two others ventured in, but\nthey fared no better.  At last one stepped forth, a great strong\nman who was famous for his warlike deeds, and said, you will not\ndrive away the monster by merely looking at him, we must be in\nearnest here, but I see that you have all tuned into women, and\nnot one of you dares to encounter the animal.  He ordered them\nto give him some armor, had a sword and spear brought, and armed\nhimself.  All praised his courage, though many feared for his\nlife.  The two barn-doors were opened, and they saw the owl, which\nin the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great\ncross-beam.  He had a ladder brought, and when he raised it, and\nmade ready to climb up, they all cried out to him that he was to\nbear himself bravely, and commended him to St. George, who slew\nthe dragon.  When he had just got to the top, and the owl\nperceived that he had designs on her, and was also bewildered by\nthe crowd and the shouting, and knew not how to escape, she\nrolled her eyes, ruffled her feathers, flapped her wings,\nsnapped her beak, and cried, tuwhit, tuwhoo, in a harsh voice.\nStrike home.  Strike home.  Screamed the crowd outside to the\nvaliant hero.  Any one who was standing where I am standing,\nanswered he, would not cry, strike home.  He certainly did plant\nhis foot one rung higher on the ladder, but then he began to\ntremble, and half-fainting, went back again.\nAnd now there was no one left who dared to place himself in such\ndanger.  The monster, said they, has poisoned and mortally\nwounded the very strongest man among us, by snapping at him and\njust breathing on him.  Are we, too, to risk our lives.  They took\ncounsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town from\nbeing destroyed.  For a long time everything seemed to be of no\nuse, but at length the burgomaster found an expedient.  My\nopinion, said he, is that we ought, out of the common purse, to\npay for this barn, and whatsoever corn, straw, or hay it contains,\nand thus indemnify the owner, and then burn down the whole\nbuilding and the terrible beast with it.  Thus no one will have to\nendanger his life.  This is no time for thinking of expense,\nand stinginess would be ill applied.  All agreed with him.  So\nthey set fire to the barn at all four corners, and with it the\nowl was miserably burnt.  Let any one who will not believe it,\ngo thither and inquire for himself.\n'
