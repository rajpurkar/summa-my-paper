A great horned owl ventures into a barn in a small village. Daylight comes and the bird is afraid to leave the barn. The owner of the barn finds the owl inside the structure and is afraid of what he calls "the beast". All the people of the village are called together. No one, not even a strong man wearing armor, is brave enough to take on the bird. Finally the villagers decide to burn the barn and thus rid themselves of the bird.
