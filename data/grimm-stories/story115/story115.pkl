S"One day an old man and his wife were sitting in front of a\nmiserable house resting a while from their work.  Suddenly\na splendid carriage with four black horses came driving up,\nand a richly-dressed man descended from it.  The peasant stood\nup, went to the great man, and asked what he wanted, and in what\nway he could serve him.  The stranger stretched out his hand to\nthe old man, and said, I want nothing but to enjoy for once a\ncountry dish, cook me some potatoes, in the way you always have\nthem, and then I will sit down at your table and eat them with\npleasure.  The peasant smiled and said, you are a count or a\nprince, or perhaps even a duke, noble gentlemen often have such\nfancies, but you shall have your wish.  The wife then went into\nthe kitchen and began to wash and rub the potatoes, and to make\nthem into balls, as they are eaten by the country-folks.  Whilst\nshe was busy with this work, the peasant said to the stranger,\ncome into my garden with me for a while, I have still something\nto do there.  He had dug some holes in the garden, and now\nwanted to plant trees in them.  Have you no children, asked the\nstranger, who could help you with your work.  No, answered the\npeasant, I had a son, it is true, but it is long since he went\nout into the world.  He was a ne'er-do-well, clever and knowing,\nbut he would learn nothing and was full of bad tricks.  At last\nhe ran away from me, and since then I have heard nothing of him.\nThe old man took a young tree, put it in a hole, drove in a post\nbeside it, and when he had shovelled in some earth and had\ntrampled it firmly down, he tied the stem of the tree above,\nbelow, and in the middle, fast to the post by a rope of straw.\nBut tell me,\nsaid the stranger, why you don't tie that crooked knotted tree,\nwhich is lying in the corner there, bent down almost to the ground,\nto a post also that it may grow straight, as well as these.  The\nold man smiled and said, sir, you speak according to your knowledge,\nit is easy to see that you are not familiar with gardening.  That\ntree there is old, and mis-shapen, no one can make it straight now.\nTrees must be trained while they are young.  That is how it was\nwith your son, said the stranger, if you had trained him while\nhe was still young, he would not have run away.  Now he too must\nhave grown hard and mis-shapen.  Truly it is a long time since he\nwent away, replied the old man, he must have changed.  Would you\nknow him again if he were to come to you, asked the stranger.\nHardly by his face, replied the peasant, but he has a mark about\nhim, a birth-mark on his shoulder, that looks like a bean.  When\nhe had said that the stranger pulled off his coat, bared his\nshoulder, and showed the peasant the bean.  Good God, cried the\nold man, you are really my son, and love for his child stirred\nin his heart.  But, he added, how can you be my son, you have\nbecome a great lord and live in wealth and luxury.  How have you\ncontrived to do that.  Ah, father, answered the son, the young\ntree was bound to no post and has grown crooked.  Now it is too\nold, it will never be straight again.  How have I come by all this.\nI have become a thief, but do not be alarmed, I am a master-thief.\nFor me there are neither locks nor bolts, whatsoever I desire is\nmine.  Do not imagine that I steal like a common thief, I only\ntake some of the superfluity of the rich.  Poor people are safe,\nI would rather give to them than take anything from them.  It is\nthe same with anything which I can have without trouble, cunning,\nand dexterity - I never touch it.  Alas, my son, said the father,\nit still does not please me, a thief is still a thief, I tell you\nit will end badly.  He took him to his mother, and when she heard\nthat was her son, she wept for joy, but when he told her that he\nhad become a master-thief, two streams flowed down over her\nface.  At length she said, even if he has become a thief, he is\nstill my son, and my eyes have beheld him once more.\nThey sat down to table, and once again he ate with his parents\nthe wretched food which he had not eaten for so long.  The father\nsaid, if our lord, the count up there in the castle, learns who\nyou are, and what trade you follow, he will not take you in his\narms and cradle you in them as he did when he held you at the font,\nbut will cause you to swing from a halter.  Be easy, father, he\nwill do me no harm, for I understand my trade.  I will go to him\nmyself this very day.  When evening drew near, the master-thief\nseated himself in his carriage, and drove to the castle.  The\ncount received him civilly, for he took him for a distinguished\nman.  When, however, the stranger made himself known, the count\nturned pale and was quite silent for some time.  At length he\nsaid, you are my godson, and on that account mercy shall take\nthe place of justice, and I will deal leniently with you.  Since\nyou pride yourself on being a master-thief, I will put your art\nto the proof, but if you do not stand the test, you must marry\nthe rope-maker's daughter, and the croaking of the raven must be\nyour music on the occasion.  Lord count, answered the\nmaster-thief, think of three things, as difficult as you like,\nand if I do not perform your tasks, do with me what you will.\nThe count reflected for some minutes, and then said, well, then,\nin the first place, you shall steal the horse I keep for my own\nriding, out of the stable.  In the next, you shall steal the\nsheet from beneath the bodies of my wife and myself when we are\nasleep, without our observing it, and the wedding-ring of my wife\nas well.  Thirdly and lastly, you shall steal away out of the\nchurch, the parson and clerk.  Mark what I am saying, for\nyour life depends on it.\nThe master-thief went to the nearest town, there he bought the\nclothes of an old peasant woman, and put them on.  Then he stained\nhis face brown, and painted wrinkles on it as well, so that no one\ncould have recognized him.  Then he filled a small cask with old\nhungary wine in which was mixed a powerful sleeping-drink.  He\nput the cask in a basket, which he took on his back, and walked\nwith slow and tottering steps to the count's castle.  It was\nalready dark when he arrived.  He sat down on a stone in the\ncourt-yard and began to cough, like an asthmatic old woman, and to\nrub his hands as if he were cold.  In front of the door of the\nstable some soldiers were\nlying round a fire, one of them observed the woman, and called out\nto her, come nearer, old mother, and warm yourself beside us.\nAfter all, you have no bed for the night, and must take one where\nyou can find it.  The old woman tottered up to them, begged them\nto lift the basket from her back, and sat down beside them at the\nfire.  What have you got in your little cask, old hag, asked one.\nA good mouthful of wine, she answered.  I live by trade, for\nmoney and fair words I am quite ready to let you have a glass.\nLet us have it here, then, said the soldier, and when he had\ntasted one glass he said, when wine is good, I like another glass,\nand had another poured out for himself, and the rest followed his\nexample.  Hallo, comrades, cried one of them to those who were in\nthe stable, here is an old girl who has wine that is as old as\nherself, take a draught, it will warm your stomachs far better\nthan our fire.  The old woman carried her cask into the stable.\nOne of the soldiers had seated himself on the saddled riding-horse,\nanother held its bridle in his hand, a third had laid hold of\nits tail.  She poured out as much as they wanted until the spring\nran dry.  It was not long before the bridle fell from the hand of\nthe one, and he fell down and began to snore, the other left hold\nof the tail, lay down and snored still louder.  The one who was\nsitting in the saddle, did remain sitting, but bent his head down\nalmost to the horse's neck, and slept and blew with his mouth like\nthe bellows of a forge.  The soldiers outside had already been\nasleep for a long time, and were lying on the ground motionless,\nas if dead.  When the master-thief saw that he had succeeded, he\ngave the first a rope in his hand instead of the bridle, and the\nother who had been holding the tail, a wisp of straw, but what was\nhe to do with the one who was sitting on the horse's back.  He\ndid not want to throw him down, for he might have awakened and\nhave uttered a cry.  He had a good idea, he unbuckled the girths\nof the saddle, tied a couple of ropes which were hanging to a ring\non the wall fast to the saddle, and drew the sleeping rider up\ninto the air on it, then he twisted the rope round the posts, and\nmade it fast.  He soon unloosed the horse from the chain, but if\nhe had ridden over the stony pavement of the yard they would have\nheard the noise in the castle.  So he wrapped the horse's hoofs in\nold rags, led him carefully out, leapt upon him, and\ngalloped off.\nWhen day broke, the master galloped to the castle on the stolen\nhorse.  The count had just got up, and was looking out of the\nwindow.  Good morning, sir count, he cried to him, here is the\nhorse, which I have got safely out of the stable.  Just look, how\nbeautifully your soldiers are lying there sleeping, and if you will\nbut go into the stable, you will see how comfortable your\nwatchers have made it for themselves.  The count could not help\nlaughing.  Then he said, for once you have succeeded, but things\nwon't go so well the second time, and I warn you that if you come\nbefore me as a thief, I will handle you as I would a thief.\nWhen the countess went to bed that night, she closed her hand\nwith the wedding-ring tightly together, and the count said, all\nthe doors are locked and bolted, I will keep awake and wait for\nthe thief, but if he gets in by the window, I will shoot him.\nThe master-thief, however, went in the dark to the gallows, cut a\npoor sinner who was hanging there down from the halter, and\ncarried him on his back to the castle.  Then he set a ladder up\nto the bedroom, put the dead body on his shoulders, and began to\nclimb up.  When he had got so high that the head of the dead man\nshowed at the window, the count, who was watching in his bed,\nfired a pistol at him, and immediately the master let the poor\nsinner fall down, descended the ladder, and hid himself in one\ncorner.  The night was sufficiently lighted by the moon, for the\nmaster to see distinctly how the count got out of the window on to\nthe ladder, came down, carried the dead body into the garden, and\nbegan to dig a hole in which to lay it.  Now, thought the thief,\nthe favorable moment has come, stole nimbly out of his corner, and\nclimbed up the ladder straight into the countess's bedroom.  Dear\nwife, he began in the count's voice, the thief is dead, but, after\nall, he is my godson, and has been more of a scape-grace than a\nvillain.  I will not put him to open shame, besides, I am sorry\nfor the parents.  I will bury him myself before daybreak in the\ngarden, that the thing may not be known.  So give me the sheet,\nI will wrap up the body in it, and not bury him like a dog.  The\ncountess gave him the sheet.  I tell you what, continued the\nthief, I have a fit of magnanimity, give me the ring too, - the\nunhappy man risked his life for it, so he may take it with him\ninto his grave.  She would not gainsay the count, and although\nshe did it unwillingly she drew the ring from her finger, and\ngave it to him.  The thief made off with both these things, and\nreached home safely before the count in the garden had finished\nhis work of burying.\nWhat a long face the count did pull when the master came next\nmorning, and brought him the sheet and the ring.  Are you a\nwizard, said he, who has fetched you out of the grave in which\nI myself laid you, and brought you to life again.  You did not\nbury me, said the thief, but the poor sinner on the gallows,\nand he told him exactly how everything had happened, and the count\nwas forced to own to him that he was a clever, crafty thief.\nBut you have not reached the end yet, he added, you have still to\nperform the third task, and if you do not succeed in that, all is\nof no use.  The master smiled and returned no answer.\nWhen night had fallen he went with a long sack on his back, a\nbundle under his arms, and a lantern in his hand to the village\nchurch.  In the sack he had some crabs, and in the bundle short\nwax-candles.  He sat down in the churchyard, took out a crab, and\nstuck a  wax-candle on his back.  Then he lighted the little light,\nput the crab on the ground, and let it creep about.  He took a\nsecond out of the sack, and treated it in the same way, and so on\nuntil the last was out of the sack.  Hereupon he put on a long\nblack garment that looked like a monk's cowl, and stuck a gray\nbeard on his chin.  When at last he was quite unrecognizable, he\ntook the sack in which the crabs had been, went into the church,\nand ascended the pulpit.  The clock in the tower was just striking\ntwelve, when the last stroke had sounded, he cried with a loud\nand piercing voice, hearken, sinful men, the end of all things\nhas come.  The last day is at hand.  Hearken.  Hearken.\nWhosoever wishes to go to heaven with me must creep into the sack.\nI am peter, who opens and shuts the gate of heaven.  Behold how\nthe dead outside there in the chuchyard are wandering about\ncollecting their bones.  Come, come, and creep into the sack, the\nworld is about to be destroyed.  The cry echoed through the whole\nvillage.  The parson and clerk who lived nearest to the church,\nheard it first, and when they saw the lights which were moving\nabout the churchyard, they observed that something unusual was\ngoing on, and went into the church.  They listened to the sermon\nfor a while, and then the clerk nudged the parson and said, it\nwould not be amiss if we were to use the opportunity together, and\nbefore the dawning of the last day, find an easy way of getting\nto heaven.  To tell the truth, answered the parson, that is what I\nmyself have been thinking, so if you are inclined, we will set out\non our way.  Yes, answered the clerk, but you, the pastor, have\nthe precedence, I will follow.  So the parson went first, and\nascended the pulpit where the master opened his\nsack.  The parson crept in first, and then the clerk.  The master\nimmediately tied up the sack tightly, seized it by the middle, and\ndragged it down the pulpit-steps, and whenever the heads of the\ntwo fools bumped against the steps, he cried, we are going over\nthe mountains.  Then he drew them through the village in the same\nway, and when they were passing through puddles, he cried, now\nwe are going through wet clouds.  And when at last he was dragging\nthem up the steps of the castle, he cried, now we are on the\nsteps of heaven, and will soon be in the outer court.  When he had\ngot to the top, he pushed the sack into the pigeon-house, and when\nthe pigeons fluttered about, he said, hark how glad the angels are,\nand how they are flapping their wings.  Then he bolted the door\nupon them, and went away.\nNext morning he went to the count, and told him that he had\nperformed the third task also, and had carried the parson and clerk\nout of the church.  Where have you left them, asked the Lord.\nThey are lying upstairs in a sack in the pigeon-house, and\nimagine that they are in heaven.  The count went up himself, and\nconvinced himself that the master had told the truth.  When he had\ndelivered the parson and clerk from their captivity, he said, you\nare an arch-thief, and have won your wager.  For once you escape\nwith a whole skin, but see that you leave my land, for if ever you\nset foot on it again, you may count on your elevation to the\ngallows.  The arch-thief took leave of his parents, once more\nwent forth into the wide world, and no one has ever heard of\nhim since.\n"
