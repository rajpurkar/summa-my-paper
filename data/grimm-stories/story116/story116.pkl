The mother goat then instructs the kids to find rocks, which she sews up in the wolf's belly. The wolf wakes up thirsty.

S"There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day\nshe wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called\nall seven to her and said, dear children, I have to go into the\nforest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he will\ndevour you all - skin, hair, and everything.  The wretch often\ndisguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice\nand his black feet.  The kids said, dear mother, we will take good\ncare of ourselves, you may go away without any anxiety.  Then the old\none bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.\n\nIt was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called,\nopen the door, dear children, your mother is here, and has brought\nsomething back with her for each of you.  But the little kids knew\nthat it was the wolf, by the rough voice.  We will not open the door,\ncried they, you are not our mother.  She has a soft, pleasant voice,\nbut your voice is rough, you are the wolf.  Then the wolf went away\nto a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this\nand made his voice soft with it. The he came back, knocked at the\ndoor of the house, and called, open the door, dear children, your\nmother is here and has brought something back with her for each of\nyou.  But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and\nthe children saw them and cried, we will not open the door, our\nmother has not black feet like you, you are the wolf.  Then the wolf\nran to a baker and said, I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over\nthem for me.  And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to\nthe miller and said, strew some white meal over my feet for me.  The\nmiller thought to himself, the wolf wants to deceive someone, and\nrefused, but the wolf said, if you will not do it, I will devour you.\nThen the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly,\nthis the way of mankind.\n\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked\nat it and said, open the door for me, children, your dear little\nmother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back\nfrom the forest with her.  The little kids cried, first show us your\npaws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.  Then he put\nhis paws in through the window, and when the kids saw that they were\nwhite, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door.\nBut who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to\nhide themselves.  One sprang under the table, the second into the\nbed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth\ninto the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh\ninto the clock-case.  But the wolf found them all, and used no great\nceremony, one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.  The\nyoungest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not\nfind. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off,\nlaid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began\nto sleep.  Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the\nforest.  Ah.  What a sight she saw there.  The house-door stood wide\nopen.  The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the\nwashing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were\npulled off the bed.  She sought her children, but they were nowhere\nto be found.  She called them one after another by name, but no one\nanswered.  At last, when she caame to the youngest, a soft voice\ncried, dear mother, I am in the clock-case.  She took the kid out,\nand it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others.\nThen you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\n\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with\nher.  When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree\nand snored so loud that the branches shook.  She looked at him on\nevery side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his\ngorged belly.  Ah, heavens, she said, is it possible that my poor\nchildren whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still\nalive.  Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle\nand thread and the goat cut open the monster's stomach, and hardly\nhad she make one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and\nwhen she cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were\nall still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his\ngreediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.  What rejoicing\nthere was.  They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a sailor\nat his wedding.  The mother, however, said, now go and look for some\nbig stones, and we will fill the wicked beast's stomach with them\nwhile he is still asleep.  Then the seven kids dragged the stones\nthither with all speed, and put as many of them into his stomach as\nthey could get in, and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest\nhaste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.\n\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his\nlegs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he\nwanted to go to a well to drink.  But when he began to walk and move\nabout, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and\nrattled.  Then cried he,  what rumbles and tumbles against my poor\nbones.  I thought 'twas six kids,  but it feels like big stones. And\nwhen he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he had to drown miserably.  When\nthe seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried\naloud, the wolf is dead.  The wolf is dead, and danced for joy round\nabout the well with their mother.\n"
