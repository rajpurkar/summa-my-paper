A wolf tricks seven kids into letting it into their house. The wolf eats all of the kids except one. The mother goat returns to find only one kid alive. The mother goat seeks out the wolf who is sleeping his meal off. She sees movement in the wolf's belly and cuts the belly open. All six kids jump out alive and well. The mother goat then instructs the kids to find rocks, which she sews up in the wolf's belly. The wolf wakes up thirsty. When he tries to get something to drink, the weight of the rocks pulls him into the well where he drowns.
