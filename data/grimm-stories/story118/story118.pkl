S"A count meets an old woman in the woods and speaks to her. The old woman asks the count if he will carry her baskets of fruit and bundles of grass home for her. He picks up the parcels and they become so heavy he can barely walk up the hill with them. To make matters worse, the old lady herself jumps up on the count's back and begins to whip him. As they approach the house, the old lady's ugly daughter comes walking behind the geese. The count lies down on a bench and goes to sleep. The old lady wakes him by giving him an emerald box which she says will bring him riches. At the nearest town, the count presents this box to the king and queen. The queen faints when she sees it, and then..."

S"There was once upon a time a very old woman, who lived with her\nflock of geese in a remote clearing in the mountains, and there\nhad a little house.  The clearing was surrounded by a large forest,\nand every morning the old woman took her crutch and hobbled\ninto it.  There, however, she was quite active, more so than\nany one would have thought, considering her age, and collected\ngrass for her geese, picked all the wild fruit she could\nreach, and carried everything home on her back.  Anyone would have\nthought that the heavy load would have weighed her to the ground,\nbut she always brought it safely home.  If anyone met her, she\ngreeted him quite courteously.  Good day, dear countryman, it\nis a fine day.  Ah, you wonder that I should drag grass about, but\neveryone must take his burden on his back.  Nevertheless, people\ndid not like to meet her if they could help it, and took by\npreference a round-about way, and when a father with his boys\npassed her, he whispered to them, beware of the old woman.  She\nhas claws beneath her gloves.  She is a witch.\nOne morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest.\nThe sun shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept\nthrough the leaves, and he was full of joy and gladness.  He\nhad as yet met no one, when he suddenly perceived the old witch\nkneeling on the ground cutting grass with a sickle.  She had\nalready thrust a whole load into her bundle, and near it stood\ntwo baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears.  But,\ngood little mother, said he, how can you carry all that away.  I\nmust carry it, dear sir, answered she, rich folk's children\nhave no need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the\nsaying goes, don't look behind you, you will only see how crooked\nyour back is.\nWill you help me, she said, as he remained standing by her.\nYou have still a straight back and young legs, it would be a\ntrifle to you.  Besides, my house is not so very far from here,\nit stands there on the heath behind the hill.  How soon you\nwould bound up thither.  The young man took compassion on the\nold woman.  My father is certainly no peasant, replied he, but\na rich count.  Nevertheless, that you may see that it is not only\npeasants who can carry things, I will take your bundle.  If\nyou will try it, said she, I shall be very glad.  You will\ncertainly have to walk for an hour, but what will that matter to\nyou, only you must carry the apples and pears as well.  The young\nman felt somewhat uneasy when he heard of an hour's walk, but the\nold woman would not let him off, packed the bundle on his back,\nand hung the two baskets on his arm.  See, it is quite light, said\nshe.  No, it is not light, answered the count, and pulled a rueful\nface.  Verily, the bundle weighs as heavily as if it were full of\ncobblestones, and the apples and pears are as heavy as lead.  I\ncan scarcely breathe.  He had a mind to put everything down\nagain, but the old woman would not allow it.  Just look, said\nshe mockingly, the young gentleman will not carry what I, an old\nwoman, have so often dragged along.  You are ready with fine words,\nbut when it comes to be earnest, you want to take to your heels.\nWhy are you standing loitering there.  She continued, step out.\nNo one will take the bundle off again.  As long as he walked on\nlevel ground, it was still bearable, but when they came to the hill\nand had to climb, and the stones rolled down under his feet as if\nthey were alive, it was beyond his strength.  Drops of sweat stood\non his forehead, and ran, hot and cold, down his back.  Mother,\nsaid he, I can go no farther.  I want to rest a little.  Not\nhere, answered the old woman, when we have arrived at our journey's\nend, you can rest.  But now you must go forward.  Who knows\nwhat good it may do you.  Old woman, you are becoming shameless,\nsaid the count, and tried to throw off the bundle, but he labored\nin vain.  It stuck as fast to his back as if it grew there.\nHe turned and twisted, but he could not get rid of it.  The old\nwoman laughed at this, and sprang about quite delighted on\nher crutch.  Don't get angry, dear sir, said she, you are growing\nas\nred in the face as a turkey-cock.  Carry your bundle patiently.\nI will give you a good present when we get home.\nWhat could he do.  He was obliged to submit to his fate, and\ncrawl along patiently behind the old woman.  She seemed to grow\nmore and more nimble, and his burden still heavier.  All\nat once she made a bound, jumped on to the bundle and seated\nherself on the top of it.  And however withered she might be,\nshe was yet heavier than the stoutest country lass.  The\nyouth's knees trembled, but when he did not go on, the old woman\nhit him about the legs with a switch and with stinging-nettles.\nGroaning continually, he climbed the mountain, and at length\nreached the old woman's house, when he was just about to drop.\nWhen the geese perceived the old woman, they flapped their wings,\nstretched out their necks, ran to meet her, cackling all the\nwhile.  Behind the flock walked, stick in hand, an old wench,\nstrong and big, but ugly as night.  Good mother, said she to\nthe old woman, has anything happened to you, you have stayed\naway so long.  By no means, my dear daughter, answered she,\nI have met with nothing bad, but, on the contrary, with this\nkind gentleman, who has carried my burden for me.  Only think,\nhe even took me on his back when I was\ntired.  The way, too, has not seemed long to us.  We have been\nmerry, and have been cracking jokes with each other all the\ntime.  At last the old woman slid down, took the bundle off the\nyoung man's back, and the baskets from his arm, looked at him\nquite kindly, and said, now seat yourself on the bench before\nthe door, and rest.  You have fairly earned your wages, and they\nshall not be wanting.  Then she said to the goose-girl, go\ninto the house, my dear daughter, it is not becoming for you\nto be alone with a young gentleman.  One must not pour oil on to\nthe fire, he might fall in love with you.  The count knew not\nwhether to laugh or to cry.  Such a sweetheart as that, thought\nhe, could not touch my heart, even if she were thirty years\nyounger.  In the meantime the old woman stroked\nand fondled her geese as if they were children, and then went\ninto the house with her daughter.  The youth lay down on the\nbench, under a wild apple-tree.  The air was warm and mild.  On\nall sides stretched a green meadow, which was set with cowslips,\nwild thyme, and a thousand other flowers.  Through the midst\nof it rippled a clear brook on which the sun sparkled, and\nthe white geese went walking backwards and forwards, or paddled in\nthe water.  It is quite delightful here, said he, but I am so\ntired that I cannot keep my eyes open.  I will sleep a little.\nIf only a gust of wind does not come and blow my legs off my\nbody, for they are as rotten as tinder.\nWhen he had slept a little while, the old woman came and shook\nhim till he awoke.  Sit up, said she, you can not stay here.  I\nhave certainly treated you ill enough, still it has not cost you\nyour life.  Of money and land you have no need, here is something\nelse for you.  Thereupon she thrust a little box into his hand,\nwhich was cut out of a single emerald.  Take great care of it,\nsaid she, it will bring you good fortune.  The count sprang up,\nand as he felt that he was quite fresh, and had recovered his\nvigor, he thanked the old woman for her present, and set off\nwithout even once looking back at the beautiful daughter.  When\nhe was already some way off, he still heard in the distance the\nnoisy cry of the geese.\nFor three days the count had to wander in the wilderness before\nhe could find his way out.  He then reached a large town, and as\nno\none knew him, he was led into the royal palace, where the king\nand queen were sitting on their throne.  The count fell on one\nknee, drew the emerald box out of his pocket, and laid it at the\nqueen's feet.  She bade him rise and hand her the little box.\nHardly, however, had she opened it, and looked therein, than she\nfell as if dead to the ground.  The count was seized by the king's\nservants, and was being led to prison, when the queen opened\nher eyes, and ordered them to release him, and every one was to\ngo out, as she wished to speak with him in private.\nWhen the queen was alone, she began to weep bitterly, and said,\nof what use to me are the splendors and honors with which I am\nsurrounded.  Every morning I awake in pain and sorrow.  I had\nthree daughters, the youngest of whom was so beautiful that the\nwhole world looked on her as a wonder.  She was as white as snow,\nas rosy as apple-blossom, and her hair as radiant as sun-beams.\nWhen she cried, not tears fell from her eyes, but pearls and\njewels only.  When she was fifteen years old, the king summoned\nall three sisters to come before his throne.  You should have seen\nhow all the people gazed when the youngest entered, it was just\nas if the sun were rising.  Then the king spoke, my daughters,\nI know not when my last day may arrive.  I will to-day decide what\neach shall receive at my death.  You all love me, but the one\nof you who loves me best, shall fare the best.  Each of them\nsaid she loved him best.  Can you not express to me, said the king,\nhow much you do love me, and thus I shall see what you mean.  The\neldest spoke, I love my father as dearly as the sweetest sugar.\nThe second, I love my father as dearly as my prettiest dress.  But\nthe youngest was silent.  Then the father said, and you,\nmy dearest child, how much do you love me.  I do not know, and\ncan compare my love with nothing.  But her father insisted that\nshe should name something.  So she said at last, the best food\ndoes not please me without salt, therefore I love my father\nlike salt.  When the king heard that, he fell into a passion, and\nsaid, if you love me like salt, your love shall also be repaid you\nwith salt.  Then he divided the kingdom between the two elder,\nbut caused a sack of salt to be bound on the back of the\nyoungest, and two servants had to lead her forth into the\nwild forest.  We all begged and prayed for her, said the queen,\nbut the king's anger was not to be appeased.  How she cried\nwhen she had to leave us.  The whole road was strewn with the\npearls which flowed from her eyes.  The king soon afterwards\nrepented of his great severity, and had the whole forest\nsearched for the poor child, but no one could find her.  When\nI think that the wild beasts have devoured her, I know not how\nto contain myself for sorrow.  Many a time I console myself\nwith the hope that she is still alive, and may have hidden herself\nin a cave, or has found shelter with compassionate people.  But\npicture to yourself, when I opened your little emerald box, a\npearl lay therein, of exactly the same kind as those which used\nto fall from my daughter's eyes.  And then you can also imagine\nhow the sight of it stirred my heart.  You must tell me how you\ncame by that pearl.  The count told her that he had received it\nfrom the old woman in the forest, who had appeared very strange\nto him, and must be a witch, but he had neither seen nor heard\nanything of the queen's child.  The king and the queen resolved\nto seek out the old woman.  They thought that there where the\npearl had been, they would obtain news of their daughter.\n\nThe old woman was sitting in that lonely place at her spinning-wheel\nspinning.  It was already dusk, and a log which was burning\non the hearth gave a scanty light.  All at once there was a noise\noutside, the geese were coming home from the pasture, and uttering\ntheir hoarse cries.  Soon afterwards the daughter also entered.\nBut the old woman scarcely thanked her, and only shook her\nhead a little.  The daughter sat down beside her, took her\nspinning-wheel, and twisted the threads as nimbly as a young girl.\nThus they both sat for two hours, and exchanged never a word.  At\nlast something rustled at the window and two fiery eyes peered\nin.  It was an old night-owl, which cried 'uhu, three times.  The\nold woman looked up just a little, then she said, now, my little\ndaughter, it is time for you to go out and do your work.  She rose\nand went out, and where did she go.  Over the meadows ever onward\ninto the valley.  At last she came to a well, with three old\noak-trees standing beside it.  Meanwhile\nthe moon had risen large and round over the mountain, and\nit was so light that one could have found a needle.  She removed\na skin which covered her face, then bent down to the well, and\nbegan to wash herself.  When she had finished, she dipped the\nskin also in the water, and then laid it on the meadow, so that\nit should bleach in the moonlight, and dry again.  But how the\nmaiden was changed.  Such a change as that was never seen before.\nWhen the gray mask fell off, her golden hair broke forth like\nsun-beams, and spread about like a mantle over her whole form.\nHer eyes shone out as brightly as the stars in heaven, and her\ncheeks bloomed a soft red like apple-blossom.\nBut the fair maiden was sad.  She sat down and wept bitterly.\nOne tear after another forced itself out of her eyes, and rolled\nthrough her long hair to the ground.  There she sat, and would\nhave remained sitting a long time, if there had not been a rustling\nand cracking in the boughs of the neighboring tree.  She sprang\nup like a roe which has been overtaken by the shot of the hunter.\nJust then the moon was obscured by a dark cloud, and in an instant\nthe maiden had put on the old skin and vanished, like a light\nblown out by the wind.\nShe ran back home, trembling like an aspen-leaf.  The old woman\nwas standing on the threshold, and the girl was about to relate\nwhat had befallen her, but the old woman laughed kindly, and\nsaid, I already know all.  She led her into the room and lighted\na new log.  She did not, however, sit down to her spinning again,\nbut fetched a broom and began to sweep and scour.  All must be\nclean and sweet, she said to the girl.  But, mother, said the\nmaiden, why do you begin work at so late an hour.  What do you\nexpect.  Do you know then what time it is, asked the old woman.\nNot yet midnight, answered the maiden, but already past eleven\no'clock.  Do you not remember, continued the old woman, that\nit is three years to-day since you came to me.  Your time is up,\nwe can no longer remain together.  The girl was terrified, and\nsaid, alas, dear mother, will you cast me off.  Where shall I go.\nI have no friends, and no home to which I can go.  I have always\ndone as you\nbade me, and you have always been satisfied with me.  Do not send\nme away.  The old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before\nher.  My stay here is over, she said to her, but when I depart,\nhouse and parlor must be clean.  Therefore do not hinder me in\nmy work.  Have no care for yourself, you shall find a roof to\nshelter you, and the wages which I will give you shall also\ncontent you.  But tell me what is about to happen, the maiden\ncontinued to entreat.  I tell you again, do not hinder me in my\nwork.  Do not say a word more, go to your chamber, take the skin\noff your face, and put on the silken gown which you had on when\nyou came to me, and then wait in your chamber until I call you.\nBut I must once more tell of the king and queen, who had\njourneyed forth with the count in order to seek out the old woman\nin the wilderness.  The count had strayed away from them in the\nwood by night, and had to walk onwards alone.  Next day it seemed\nto him that he was on the right track.  He still went forward,\nuntil darkness came on, then he climbed a tree, intending to\npass the night there, for he feared that he might lose his way.\nWhen the moon illumined the surrounding country he perceived a\nfigure coming down the mountain.  She had no stick in her hand,\nbut yet he could see that it was the goose-girl, whom he had\nseen before in the house of the old woman.  Oho, cried he, there\nshe comes, and if I once get hold of one of the witches, the\nother shall not escape me.  But how astonished he was, when\nshe went to the well, took off the skin and washed herself,\nwhen her golden hair fell down all about her, and she was\nmore beautiful than anyone whom he had ever seen in the whole\nworld.  He hardly dared to breathe, but stretched his head as\nfar forward through the leaves as he could, and stared at her.\nEither he bent over too far, or whatever the cause might be, the\nbough suddenly cracked, and that very moment the maiden slipped\ninto the skin, sprang away like a roe, and as the moon was\nsuddenly covered, disappeared from his sight.  Hardly had she\ndisappeared, before the count descended from the tree, and\nhastened after her with nimble steps.  He had not been gone\nlong before he saw, in the twilight, two figures coming over\nthe meadow.\nIt was the king and queen, who had perceived from a distance the\nlight shining in the old woman's little house, and were going\nto it.  The count told them what wonderful things he had seen\nby the well, and they did not doubt that it had been their lost\ndaughter.  They walked onwards full of joy, and soon came to the\nlittle house.  The geese were sitting all round it, and had\nthrust their heads under their wings and were sleeping, and not\none of them moved.  The king and queen looked in at the window,\nwhere the old woman was sitting quite quietly spinning, nodding\nher head and never looking round.  The room was perfectly clean,\nas if the little mist men, who carry no dust on their feet, lived\nthere.  Their daughter, however, they did not see.  They gazed at\nall this for a long time, until at last they took heart, and\nknocked softly at the window.  The old woman appeared to have\nbeen expecting them.  She rose, and called out quite kindly,\ncome in.  I know you already.  When they had entered the room,\nthe old woman said, you might have spared yourself the long\nwalk, if you had not three years ago unjustly driven away\nyour child, who is so good and lovable.  No harm has come to her.\nFor three years she has had to tend the geese.  With them she has\nlearnt no evil, but has preserved her purity of heart.  You,\nhowever, have been sufficiently punished by the misery in which\nyou have lived.  Then she went to the chamber and called, come\nout, my little daughter.  Thereupon the door opened, and the\nprincess stepped out in her silken garments, with her golden\nhair and her shining eyes, and it was as if an angel from heaven\nhad entered.\nShe went up to her father and mother, fell on their necks and\nkissed them.  There was no help for it, they all had to weep for\njoy.  The young count stood near them, and when she perceived him\nshe became as red in the face as a moss-rose, she herself did\nnot know why.  The king said, my dear child, I have given away\nmy kingdom, what shall I give you.  She needs nothing, said\nthe old woman.  I give her the tears that she has wept on your\naccount.  They are precious pearls, finer than those that are\nfound in the sea, and worth more than your whole kingdom, and I\ngive her my little\nhouse as payment for her services.  When the old woman had said\nthat, she disappeared from their sight.  The walls rattled a\nlittle, and when the king and queen looked round, the little\nhouse had changed into a splendid palace, a royal table had been\nspread, and the servants were running hither and thither.\nThe story goes still further, but my grandmother, who related\nit to me, had partly lost her memory, and had forgotten the rest.\nI shall always believe that the beautiful princess married the\ncount, and that they remained together in the palace, and\nlived there in all happiness so long as God willed it.  Whether\nthe snow-white geese, which were kept near the little hut, were\nverily young maidens no one need take offence, whom the old\nwoman had taken under her protection, and whether they now\nreceived their human form again, and stayed as handmaids to the\nyoung queen, I do not exactly know, but I suspect it.  This\nmuch is certain, that the old woman was no witch, as people\nthought, but a wise woman, who meant well.  Very likely it was\nshe who, at the princess's birth, gave her the gift of weeping\npearls instead of tears.  That does not happen nowadays, or else\nthe poor would soon become rich.\n"
