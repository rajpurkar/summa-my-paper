S'A man has gambled to the point he has lost everything that he owns. The day before he is to lose his house, the Lord and St. Peter come to stay with him. They grant Hansel three wishes, but he wishes only for means to continue gambling. Even after Hansel dies, he continues to gamble in both heaven and hell. He is finally thrown to the earth, where the bits of his soul go into the compulsive gamblers of today. '

S"Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and\nfor that reason people never called him anything but gambling\nHansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house\nand all that he had.  Now the very day before his creditors were\nto take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and\nasked him to give them shelter for the night.  Then gambling Hansel\nsaid, for my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you\na bed or anything to eat.  So the Lord said he was just to take\nthem in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which\ngambling Hansel made no objection.  Thereupon St. Peter gave him\nthree groschen, and said he was to go to the baker's and fetch\nsome bread.  So gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house\nwhere the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they,\nalthough they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously,\nand said, Hansel, do come in.  Oh, said he, do you want to win\nthree groschen too.  On this they would not let him go.  So he\nwent in, and played away the three groschen also.  Meanwhile\nSt. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in\ncoming, they set out to meet him.  When gambling Hansel came,\nhowever, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter,\nand kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but\nour Lord already\nknew that he had lost it in play.  St. Peter again gave him\nthree groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away\nonce more, but fetched them the loaf.  Our Lord then inquired if\nhe had no wine, and he said, alack, sir, the casks are all empty.\nBut the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best\nwine was still there.  For a long time he would not believe\nthis, but at length he said, well, I will go down, but I know\nthat there is none there.  When he turned the tap, however, lo\nand behold, the best of wine ran out.  So he took it to them, and\nthe two passed the night there.  Early next day our Lord told\ngambling Hansel that he might beg three favors.  The Lord\nexpected that he would ask to go to heaven, but gambling Hansel\nasked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything,\nfor dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree\nwhereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who\nhad climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so.  The Lord\ngave him all that he had asked, and departed with St. Peter.\nAnd now gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real\nearnest, and before long he had gained half the world.  Upon this\nSt. Peter said to the Lord, Lord, this thing must not go on, at\nlast he will win the whole world.  We must send death to him.\nAnd they sent death to him.  When death appeared, gambling Hansel\nhad just seated himself at the gaming-table, and death said,\nHansel, come out a while.  But gambling Hansel said, just wait\na little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into\nthat tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have\nsomething to munch on our way.  Thereupon death climbed up, but\nwhen he wanted to come down again, he could not, and gambling\nHansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one\ndied.\nSo St. Peter said to the Lord, Lord, this thing must not go on.\nPeople no longer die, we must go ourselves.  And they went\nthemselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let death come down.\nSo Hansel went at once to death and said to him, come down, and\ndeath took him directly and put an end to him.  They went away\ntogether and came to the next world, and then gambling\nHansel made straight for the door of heaven, and knocked at it.\nWho is there.  Gambling Hansel.  Ah, we will have nothing to do\nwith him.  Begone.  So he went to the door of purgatory, and\nknocked once more.  Who is there.  Gambling Hansel.  Ah, there is\nquite enough weeping and wailing here without him.  We do not\nwant to gamble, just go away again.  Then he went to the door of\nhell, and there they let him in.  There was, however, no one at\nhome but old lucifer and the crooked devils - the straight ones\nwere just busy in the world.  And no sooner was Hansel there than\nhe sat down to gamble again.  Lucifer, however, had nothing to\nlose, but his mis-shapen devils, and gambling Hansel won them\nfrom him, as with his cards he could not fail to do.  And now he\nwas off again with his crooked devils, and they went to hohenfurt\nand pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to heaven and began to\nthrust the pole against it, and heaven began to crack.  So again\nSt. Peter said, Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him\nin, or he will overthrow the whole heaven.  And they let him in.\nBut gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was\nsuch a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they\nthemselves were saying.  Therefore St. Peter once more said,\nLord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make\nall heaven rebellious.  So they went to him at once, and threw\nhim down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the\ngambling vagabonds who are living this very day.\n"
