A man has gambled to the point he has lost everything that he owns. The day before he is to lose his house, the Lord and St. Peter come to stay with him. They grant Hansel three wishes, but he wishes only for means to continue gambling. Even after Hansel dies, he continues to gamble in both heaven and hell. He is finally thrown to the earth, where the bits of his soul go into the compulsive gamblers of today.
