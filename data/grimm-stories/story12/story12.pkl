S'Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said,\n"Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?" "That is the king\nof birds," said the wolf, "before whom we must bow down." In reality\nthe bird was the willow-wren.  "If that\'s the case," said the bear,\n"I should very much like to see his royal palace, come, take me\nthither." "That is not done quite as you seem to think," said the\nwolf, "you must wait until the queen comes." Soon afterwards the\nqueen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord king came too,\nand they began to feed their young ones.  The bear would have liked\nto go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said,\nno, you must wait until the lord and lady queen have gone away again.\nSo they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away.\n\nThe bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace,\nand when a short time had passed, went to it again.  The king and\nqueen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young\nones lying there.  "Is that the royal palace," cried the bear, "it is\na wretched palace, and you are not king\'s children, you are\ndisreputable children." When the young wrens heard that, they were\nfrightfully angry, and screamed, "No, that we are not.  Our parents\nare honest people. Bear, you will have to pay for that."\n\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into\ntheir holes.  The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and\nscream, and when their parents again brought food they said, "We will\nnot so much as touch one fly\'s leg, no, not if we were dying of\nhunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or\nnot, the bear has been here and has insulted us." Then the old king\nsaid, "Be easy, he shall be punished," and he at once flew with the\nqueen to the bear\'s cave, and called in, "Old growler, why have you\ninsulted my children? You shall suffer for it - we will punish you by\na bloody war."\n\nThus war was announced to the bear, and all four-footed animals were\nsummoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other\nanimal the earth contained.  And the willow-wren summoned everything\nwhich flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges,\nand hornets, bees and flies had to come. When the time came for the\nwar to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the\nenemy\'s commander-in-chief.\n\nThe gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the\nenemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where\nthe password was to be announced.  There stood the bear, and he\ncalled the fox before him and said, "Fox, you are the most cunning of\nall animals, you shall be general and lead us." "Good," said the fox,\n"but what signal shall we agree upon?" No one knew that, so the fox\nsaid, "I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume\nof red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going\nwell, and you must charge, but if I let it hang down, run away as\nfast as you can." When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again,\nand revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the\nwillow-wren.\n\nWhen day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed\nanimals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled.\nThe willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with\nsuch a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy\nand afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other.  But\nthe willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath\nthe fox\'s tail, and sting with all his might.  When the fox felt the\nfirst sting, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but he\nbore it, and still kept his tail high in the air, at the second\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment, at the third, he\ncould hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his\nlegs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began\nto flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\n\nThen the king and queen flew home to their children and cried,\n"Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\'s content, we have\nwon the battle.  But the young wrens said, we will not eat yet, the\nbear must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are\nhonorable children, before we will do that." Then the willow-wren\nflew to the bear\'s hole and cried, "Growler, you are to come to the\nnest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your\nbody shall be broken." So the bear crept thither in the greatest\nfear, and begged their pardon.  And now at last the young wrens were\nsatisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry\ntill quite late into the night.\n'
