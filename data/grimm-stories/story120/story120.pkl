S"Twin brothers are adopted by a huntsman and taught the craft of hunting. As adults, the twins venture out in the world and gain a variety of animal companions. These baby animals&mdash;two hares, two foxes, two wolves, two bears and two lions&mdash;are gifts given to the brothers for not shooting adult animals for food. The boys split up and divide the animals between them. One marries a princess but is turned into stone by a witch. The second twin goes to save his brother and is mistaken for the princess's husband. He saves his brother but is then killed because his twin believes he has been unfaithful with the princess. In his sorrow,  the first brother brings the second back to life. After he returns home and talks to his wife, he realizes his brother was true to him..."

S"There were once upon a time two brothers, one rich and the other\npoor.  The rich one was a goldsmith and evil-hearted. The poor one\nsupported himself by making brooms, and was good and honorable.  He\nhad two children, who were twin brothers and as like each other as\ntwo drops of water.  The two boys went in and out of the rich house,\nand often got some of the scraps to eat.  It happened once when the\npoor man was going into the forest to fetch brush-wood, that he saw a\nbird which was quite golden and more beautiful than any he had ever\nchanced to meet with.  He picked up a small stone, threw it at it,\nand was lucky enough to hit it, but one golden feather only fell\ndown, and the bird flew away.  The man took the feather and carried\nit to his brother, who looked at it and said, it is pure gold. And\ngave him a great deal of money for it.  Next day the man climbed into\na birch-tree, and was about to cut off a couple of branches when the\nsame bird flew out, and when the man searched he found a nest, and an\negg lay inside it, which was of gold.  He took the egg home with him,\nand carried it to his brother, who again said, it is pure gold, and\ngave him what it was worth.  At last the goldsmith said, I should\nindeed like to have the bird itself.  The poor man went into the\nforest for the third time, and again saw the golden bird sitting on\nthe tree, so he took a stone and brought it down and carried it to\nhis brother, who gave him a great heap of gold for it.  Now I can get\non, thought he, and went contentedly home.\n\nThe goldsmith was crafty and cunning, and knew very well what kind of\na bird it was.  He called his wife and said, roast me the gold bird,\nand take care that none of it is lost.  I have a fancy to eat it all\nmyself.  The bird, however, was no common one, but of so wondrous a\nkind that whosoever ate its heart and liver found every morning a\npiece of gold beneath his pillow.  The woman prepared the bird, put\nit on the spit, and let it roast.  Now it happened that while it was\non the fire, and the woman was forced to go out of the kitchen on\naccount of some other work, the two children of the poor broom-maker\nran in, stood by the spit and turned it round once or twice.  And as\nat that very moment two little bits of the bird fell down into the\npan, one of the boys said, we will eat these two little bits.  I am\nso hungry, and no one will ever miss them.  Then the two ate the\npieces, but the woman came into the kitchen and saw that they were\neating something and said, what have you been eating.  Two little\nmorsels which fell out of the bird, answered they.  That must have\nbeen the heart and the liver, said the woman, quite frightened, and\nin order that her husband might not miss them and be angry, she\nquickly killed a young cock, took out his heart and liver, and put\nthem beside the golden bird.  When it was ready, she carried it to\nthe goldsmith, who consumed it all alone, and left none of it.  Next\nmorning, however, when he felt beneath his pillow, and expected to\nbring out the piece of gold, no more gold pieces were there than\nthere had always been.\n\nThe two children did not know what a piece of good-fortune had fallen\nto their lot.  Next morning when they arose, something fell rattling\nto the ground, and when they picked it up there were two gold pieces.\nThey took them to their father, who was astonished and said, how can\nthat have happened.  When next morning they again found two, and so\non daily, he went to his brother and told him the strange story.  The\ngoldsmith at once knew how it had happened, and that the children had\neaten the heart and liver of the golden bird, and in order to revenge\nhimself, and because he was envious and hard-hearted, he said to the\nfather, your children are in league with the evil one, do not take\nthe gold, and do not suffer them to stay any longer in your house,\nfor he has them in his power, and may ruin you likewise.  The father\nfeared the evil one, and painful as it was to him, he nevertheless\nled the twins forth into the forest, and with a sad heart left them\nthere.\n\nAnd now the two children ran about the forest, and sought the way\nhome again, but could not find it, and only lost themselves more and\nmore.  At length they met with a huntsman, who asked, to whom do you\nchildren belong.  We are the poor broom-maker's boys, they replied,\nand they told him that their father would not keep them any longer in\nthe house because a piece of gold lay every morning under their\npillows.  Come, said the huntsman, that is nothing so very bad, if at\nthe same time you remain honest, and are not idle.  As the good man\nliked the children, and had none of his own, he took them home with\nhim and said, I will be your father, and bring you up till you are\nbig.  They learnt huntsmanship from him, and the piece of gold which\neach of them found when he awoke, was kept for them by him in case\nthey should need it in the future.\n\nWhen they were grown up, their foster-father one day took them into\nthe forest with him, and said, to-day shall you make your trial shot,\nso that I may release you from your apprenticeship, and make you\nhuntsmen.  They went with him to lie in wait and stayed there a long\ntime, but no game appeared.  The huntsman, however, looked above him\nand saw a covey of wild geese flying in the form of a triangle, and\nsaid to one of them,  shoot me down one from each corner.  He did it,\nand thus accomplished his trial shot.\n\nSoon after another covey came flying by in the form of the figure\ntwo, and the huntsman bade the other also bring down one from each\ncorner, and his trial shot was likewise successful.  Now, said the\nfoster-father, I pronounce you out of your apprenticeship.  You are\nskilled huntsmen.  Thereupon the two brothers went forth together\ninto the forest, and took counsel with each other and planned\nsomething.  And in the evening when they had sat down to supper, they\nsaid to their foster-father, we will not touch food, or take one\nmouthful, until you have granted us a request.  Said he, what, then,\nis your request.  They replied, we have now finished learning, and we\nmust prove ourselves in the world, so allow us to go away and travel.\nThen spoke the old man joyfully, you talk like brave huntsmen, that\nwhich you desire has been my wish.  Go forth, all will go well with\nyou.  Thereupon they ate and drank joyously together.\n\nWhen the appointed day came, their foster-father presented each of\nthem with a good gun and a dog, and let each of them take as many of\nhis saved-up gold pieces as he chose.  Then he accompanied them a\npart of the way, and when taking leave, he gave them a bright knife,\nand said, if ever you separate, stick this knife into a tree at the\nplace where you part, and when one of you returns, he will will be\nable to see how his absent brother is faring, for the side of the\nknife which is turned in the direction by which he went, will rust if\nhe dies, but will remain bright as long as he is alive.  The two\nbrothers went still farther onwards, and came to a forest which was\nso large that it was impossible for them to get out of it in one day.\nSo they passed the night in it, and ate what they had put in their\nhunting-pouches, but they walked all the second day likewise, and\nstill did not get out.  As they had nothing to eat, one of them said,\nwe must shoot something for ourselves or we shall suffer from hunger,\nand loaded his gun, and looked about him.  And when an old hare came\nrunning up towards them, he laid his gun on his shoulder, but the\nhare cried,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give,\nand sprang instantly into the thicket, and brought two young ones.\n\nBut the little creatures played so merrily, and were so pretty, that\nthe huntsmen could not find it in their hearts to kill them.  They\ntherefore kept them with them, and the little hares followed on foot.\nSoon after this, a fox crept past.  They were just going to shoot it,\nbut the fox cried,\n     dear hunstman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nHe, too, brought two little foxes, and the huntsmen did not like to\nkill them either, but gave them to the hares for company, and they\nfollowed behind.  It was not long before a wolf strode out of the\nthicket.  The huntsmen made ready to shoot him, but the wolf cried,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nThe huntsman put the two wolves beside the other animals, and they\nfollowed behind them.  Then a bear came who wanted to trot about a\nlittle longer, and cried,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nThe two young bears were added to the others, and there were already\neight of them.  Then who should come.  A lion came, and tossed his\nmane.  But the huntsmen did not let themselves be frightened and\naimed at him likewise, but the lion also said,\n     dear huntsman, do but let me live,\n     two little ones to thee I'll give.\n\nAnd he brought his little ones to them, and now the huntsmen had two\nlions, two bears, two wolves, two foxes, and two hares, who followed\nthem and served them.  In the meantime their hunger was not appeased\nby this, and they said to the foxes, listen you sneakers, provide us\nwith something to eat.  You are crafty and cunning.  They replied,\nnot far from here lies a village, from which we have already brought\nmany a fowl.  We will show you the way there.  So they went into the\nvillage, bought themselves something to eat, had some food given to\ntheir beasts, and then traveled onwards.  The foxes knew their way\nvery well about the district and where the poultry-yards were, and\nwere were able to guide the huntsmen.\n\nNow they traveled about for a while, but could find no situation\nwhere they could remain together, so they said, there is nothing else\nfor it, we must part.  They divided the animals, so that each of them\nhad a lion, a bear, a wolf, a fox, and a hare, then they took leave\nof each other, promised to love each other like brothers till their\ndeath, and stuck the knife which their foster-father had given them,\ninto a tree, after which one went east and the other went west.\n\nThe younger, however, arrived with his beasts in a town which was all\nhung with black crape.  He went into an inn, and asked the host if he\ncould accommodate his animals.  The innkeeper gave him a stable,\nwhere there was a hole in the wall, and the hare crept out and\nfetched himself the head of a cabbage, and the fox fetched himself a\nhen, and when he had devoured it got the cock as well, but the wolf,\nthe bear, and the lion could not get out because they were too big.\nThen the innkeeper let them be taken to a place where a cow happened\nto be lying on the grass, that they might eat till they were\nsatisfied.  And when the huntsman had taken care of his animals, he\nasked the innkeeper why the town was thus hung with black crape.\nSaid the host, because our king's only daughter is to die to-morrow.\nThe huntsman inquired, is she sick unto death.  No, answered the\nhost, she is vigorous and healthy, nevertheless she must die.  How is\nthat, asked the huntsman.\n\nThere is a high hill without the town, whereon dwells a dragon who\nevery year must have a pure virgin, or he lays the whole country\nwaste, and now all the maidens have already been given to him, and\nthere is no longer anyone left but the king's daughter, yet there is\nno mercy for her.  She must be given up to him, and that is to be\ndone to-morrow.  Said the huntsman, why is the dragon not killed.\nAh, replied the host, so many knights have tried it, but it has cost\nall of them their lives.  The king has promised that he who conquers\nthe dragon shall have his daughter to wife, and shall likewise govern\nthe kingdom after his own death.\n\nThe huntsman said nothing more to this, but next morning took his\nanimals, and with them ascended the dragon's hill.  A little church\nstood at the top of it, and on the altar three full cups were\nstanding, with the inscription.  Whosoever empties the cups will\nbecome the strongest man on earth, and will be able to wield the\nsword which is buried before the threshold of the door.  The huntsman\ndid not drink, but went out and sought for the sword in the ground,\nbut was unable to move it from its place.  Then he went in and\nemptied the cups, and now he was strong enough to take up the sword,\nand his hand could quite easily wield it.  As the hour came when the\nmaiden was to be delivered over to the dragon, the king, the marshal,\nand courtiers accompanied her.  From afar she saw the huntsman on the\ndragon's hill, and thought it was the dragon standing there waiting\nfor her, and did not want to go up to him, but at last, because\notherwise the whole town would have been destroyed, she was forced to\ntake the fatal journey.  The king and courtiers returned home full of\ngrief.  The king's marshal, however, was to stand still, and see all\nfrom a distance.\n\nWhen the king's daughter got to the top of the hill, it was not the\ndragon which stood there, but the young huntsman, who comforted her,\nand said he would save her, led her into the church, and locked her\nin.  It was not long before the seven-headed dragon came thither with\nloud roaring.  When he perceived the huntsman, he was astonished and\nsaid, what business have you here on the hill.  The huntsman\nanswered, I want to fight with you.  Said the dragon,  many knights\nhave left their lives here, I shall soon have made an end of you too,\nand he breathed fire out of seven jaws.\n\nThe fire was to have lighted the dry grass, and the huntsman was to\nhave been suffocated in the heat and smoke, but the animals came\nrunning up and trampled out the fire.  Then the dragon rushed upon\nthe huntsman, but he swung his sword until it sang through the air,\nand struck off three of his heads.  Then the dragon grew really\nfurious, and rose up in the air, and spat out flames of fire over the\nhuntsman, and was about to plunge down on him, but the huntsman once\nmore drew out his sword, and again cut off three of his heads.  The\nmonster became faint and sank down.\n\nNevertheless it was just able to rush upon the huntsman, when he with\nhis last strength smote its tail off, and as he could fight no\nlonger, called up his animals who tore it in pieces.  When the\nstruggle was ended, the huntsman unlocked the church, and found the\nking's daughter lying on the floor, as she had lost her senses with\nanguish and terror during the contest.  He carried her out, and when\nshe came to herself once more, and opened her eyes, he showed her the\ndragon all cut to pieces, and told her that she was now set free. She\nrejoiced and said, now you will be my dearest husband, for my father\nhas promised me to him who kills the dragon.  Thereupon she took off\nher necklace of coral, and divided it amongst the animals in order to\nreward them, and the lion received the golden clasp.  Her\npocket-handkerchief, however, on which was her name, she gave to the\nhuntsman, who went and cut the tongues out of the dragons, seven\nheads, wrapped them in the handkerchief, and preserved them\ncarefully.\n\nThat done, as he was so faint and weary with the fire and the battle,\nhe said to the maiden, we are both faint and weary, we will sleep\nawhile.  Then she said, yes, and they lay down on the ground, and the\nhuntsman said to the lion, you shall keep watch, that no one\nsurprises us in our sleep, and both fell asleep.  The lion lay down\nbeside them to watch, but he also was so weary with the fight, that\nhe called to the bear and said, lie down near me, I must sleep a\nlittle.  If anything comes, waken me.  Then the bear lay down beside\nhim, but he also was tired, and called the wolf and said, lie down by\nme, I must sleep a little, but if anything comes, waken me.  Then the\nwolf lay down by him, but he was tired likewise, and called the fox\nand said, lie down by me, I must sleep a little, if anything comes\nwaken me.  Then the fox lay down beside him, but he too was weary,\nand called the hare and said, lie down near me, I must sleep a\nlittle, and if anything should come, waken me.  Then the hare sat\ndown by him, but the poor hare was tired too, and had no one whom he\ncould call there to keep watch, and fell asleep.  And now the king's\ndaughter, the huntsman, the lion, the bear, the wolf, the fox, and\nthe hare, were all sleeping a sound sleep.  The marshal, however, who\nwas to look on from a distance, took courage when he did not see the\ndragon flying away with the maiden, and finding that all the hill had\nbecome quiet, ascended it.\n\nThere lay the dragon hacked and hewn to pieces on the ground, and not\nfar from it were the king's daughter and a huntsman with his animals,\nand all of them were sunk in a sound sleep.  And as he was wicked and\ngodless he took his sword, cut off the huntsman's head, and seized\nthe maiden in his arms, and carried her down the hill.  Then she\nawoke and was terrified, but the marshal said, you are in my hands,\nyou shall say that it was I who killed the dragon.\n\nI cannot do that, she replied, for it was a huntsman with his animals\nwho did it.  Then he drew his sword, and threatened to kill her if\nshe did not obey him, and so compelled her that she promised it.\nThen he took her to the king, who did not know how to contain himself\nfor joy when he once more looked on his dear child in life, whom he\nhad believed to have been torn to pieces by the monster.  The marshal\nsaid to him, I have killed the dragon, and delivered the maiden and\nthe whole kingdom as well, therefore I demand her as my wife, as was\npromised.  The king said to the maiden, is what he says true.  Ah,\nyes, she answered, it must indeed be true, but I will not consent to\nhave the wedding celebrated until after a year and a day, for she\nthought in that time she should hear something of her dear huntsman.\n\nThe animals, however, were still lying sleeping beside their dead\nmaster on the dragon's hill, and there came a great bumble-bee and\nlighted on the hare's nose, but the hare wiped it off with his paw,\nand went on sleeping.  The bumble-bee came a second time, but the\nhare again rubbed it off and slept on.  Then it came for the third\ntime, and stung his nose so that he awoke.  As soon as the hare was\nawake, he roused the fox, and the fox, the wolf, and the wolf the\nbear, and the bear the lion.  And when the lion awoke and saw that\nthe maiden was gone, and his master was dead, he began to roar\nfrightfully and cried, who has done that.  Bear, why did you not\nwaken me.  The bear asked the wolf, why did you not waken me.  And\nthe wolf the fox, why did you not waken me.  And the fox the hare,\nwhy did you not waken me.  The poor hare alone did not know what\nanswer to make, and the blame rested with him.  Then they were just\ngoing to fall upon him, but he entreated them and said, kill me not,\nI will bring our master to life again.  I know a mountain on which a\nroot grows which, when placed in the mouth of anyone, cures him of\nall illness and every wound.  But the mountain lies two hundred\nhours, journey from here.\n\nThe lion said, in four-and-twenty hours must you have run thither and\nhave come back, and have brought the root with you. Then the hare\nsprang away, and in four-and-twenty hours he was back, and brought\nthe root with him.  The lion put the huntsman's head on again, and\nthe hare placed the root in his mouth, and immediately everything\nunited together again, and his heart beat, and life came back.  Then\nthe huntsman awoke, and was alarmed when he did not see the maiden,\nand thought, she must have gone away whilst I was sleeping, in order\nto get rid of me.  The lion in his great haste had put his master's\nhead on the wrong way round, but the huntsman did not observe it\nbecause of his melancholy thoughts about the king's daughter.  But at\nnoon, when he was going to eat something, he saw that his head was\nturned backwards and could not understand it, and asked the animals\nwhat had happened to him in his sleep.  Then the lion told him that\nthey, too, had all fallen asleep from weariness, and on awaking, had\nfound him dead with his head cut off, that the hare had brought the\nlife-giving root, and that he, in his haste, had laid hold of the\nhead the wrong way, but that he would repair his mistake.  Then he\ntore the huntsman's head off again, turned it round, and the hare\nhealed it with the root.\n\nThe huntsman, however, was sad at heart, and traveled about the\nworld, and made his animals dance before people.  It came to pass\nthat precisely at the end of one year he came back to the same town\nwhere he had rescued the king's daughter from the dragon, and this\ntime the town was gaily hung with red cloth.  Then he said to the\nhost, what does this mean.  Last year the town was all hung with\nblack crape, what means the red cloth to-day.  The host answered,\nlast year our king's daughter was to have been delivered over to the\ndragon, but the marshal fought with it and killed it, and so\nto-morrow their wedding is to be solemnized, and that is why the town\nwas then hung with black crape for mourning, and is to-day covered\nwith red cloth for joy.\n\nNext day when the wedding was to take place, the huntsman said at\nmid-day to the inn-keeper, do you believe, sir host, that I while\nwith you here to-day shall eat bread from the king's own table.\n\nNay, said the host, I would bet a hundred pieces of gold that that\nwill not come true.  The huntsman accepted the wager, and set against\nit a purse with just the same number of gold pieces. Then he called\nthe hare and said, go, my dear runner, and fetch me some of the bread\nwhich the king is eating.  Now the little hare was the lowest of the\nanimals, and could not transfer this order to any the others, but had\nto get on his legs himself.  Alas. Thought he, if I bound through the\nstreets thus alone, the butchers, dogs will all be after me.  It\nhappened as he expected, and the dogs came after him and wanted to\nmake holes in his good skin.  But he sprang away, you have never seen\nthe like, and sheltered himself in a sentry-box without the soldier\nbeing aware of it.  Then the dogs came and wanted to have him out,\nbut the soldier did not understand a jest, and struck them with the\nbutt-end of his gun, till they ran away yelling and howling.  As soon\nas the hare saw that the way was clear, he ran into the palace and\nstraight to the king's daughter, sat down under her chair, and\nscratched at her foot.  Then she said, will you get away, and thought\nit was her dog.  The hare scratched her foot for the second time, and\nshe again said, will you get away, and thought it was her dog.  But\nthe hare did not let itself be turned from its purpose, and scratched\nher for the third time.  Then she peeped down, and knew the hare by\nits collar.\n\nShe took him on her lap, carried him into her chamber, and said, dear\nhare, what do you want.  He answered, my master, who killed the\ndragon, is here, and has sent me to ask for a loaf of bread like that\nwhich the king eats.  Then she was full of joy and had the baker\nsummoned, and ordered him to bring a loaf such as was eaten by the\nking.  The little hare said, but the baker must likewise carry it\nthither for me, that the butchers, dogs may do no harm to me.  The\nbaker carried if for him as far as the door of the inn, and then the\nhare got on his hind legs, took the loaf in his front paws, and\ncarried it to his master.  Then said the huntsman, behold, sir host,\nthe hundred pieces of gold are mine.  The host was astonished, but\nthe huntsman went on to say, yes, sir host, I have the bread, but now\nI will likewise have some of the king's roast meat.\n\nThe host said, I should indeed like to see that, but he would make no\nmore wagers.  The huntsman called the fox and said, my little fox, go\nand fetch me some roast meat, such as the king eats.\n\nThe red fox knew the byways better, and went by holes and corners\nwithout any dog seeing him, seated himself under the chair of the\nking's daughter, and scratched her foot.  Then she looked down and\nrecognized the fox by its collar, took him into her chamber with her\nand said, dear fox, what do you want.  He answered, my master, who\nkilled the dragon, is here, and has sent me.  I am to ask for some\nroast meat such as the king is eating.  Then she made the cook come,\nwho was obliged to prepare a roast joint, the same as was eaten by\nthe king, and to carry it for the fox as far as the door.  Then the\nfox took the dish, waved away with his tail the flies which had\nsettled on the meat, and then carried it to his master.  Behold, sir\nhost, said the huntsman, bread and meat are here but now I will also\nhave proper vegetables with it, such as are eaten by the king.  Then\nhe called the wolf, and said, dear wolf, go thither and fetch me\nvegetables such as the king eats.\n\nThen the wolf went straight to the palace, as he feared no one, and\nwhen he got to the king's daughter's parlor, he tugged at the back of\nher dress, so that she was forced to look round.  She recognized him\nby his collar, and took him into her chamber with her, and said, dear\nwolf, what do you want.  He answered, my master, who killed the\ndragon, is here, I am to ask for some vegetables, such as the king\neats.  Then she made the cook come, and he had to make ready a dish\nof vegetables, such as the king ate, and had to carry it for the wolf\nas far as the door, and then the wolf took the dish from him, and\ncarried it to his master.  Behold, sir host, said the huntsman, now I\nhave bread and meat and vegetables, but I will also have some pastry\nto eat like that which the king eats.  He called the bear, and said,\ndear bear, you are fond of licking anything sweet, go and bring me\nsome confectionery, such as the king eats.\n\nThe the bear trotted to the palace, and everyone got out of his way,\nbut when he went to the guard, they presented their muskets, and\nwould not let him go into the royal palace.  But he got up on his\nhind legs, and gave them a few boxes on the ears, right and left,\nwith his paws, so that the whole watch broke up, and then he went\nstraight to the king's daughter, placed himself behind her, and\ngrowled a little.  Then she looked behind her, knew the bear, and\nbade him go into her room with her, and said, dear bear, what do you\nwant.  He answered, my master, who killed the dragon, is here, and I\nam to ask for some confectionery such as the king eats.  Then she\nsummoned her confectioner, who had to bake confectionery such as the\nking ate, and carry it to the door for the bear.  Then the bear first\nlicked up the comfits which had rolled down, and then he stood\nupright, took the dish, and carried it to his master.  Behold, sir\nhost, said the huntsman, now I have bread, meat, vegetables and\nconfectionery, but I will drink wine also, and such as the king\ndrinks.  He called his lion to him and said, dear lion, you yourself\nlike to drink till you are tipsy, go and fetch me some wine, such as\nis drunk by the king.\n\nThen the lion strode through the streets, and the people fled from\nhim, and when he came to the watch, they wanted to bar the way\nagainst him, but he did but roar once, and they all ran away.  Then\nthe lion went to the royal apartment, and knocked at the door with\nhis tail.  The the king's daughter came forth, and was almost afraid\nof the lion, but she knew him by the golden clasp of her necklace,\nand bade him go with her into her chamber, and said, dear lion, what\nwill you have.  He answered, my master, who killed the dragon, is\nhere, and I am to ask for some wine such as is drunk by the king.\nThen she bade the cup-bearer be called, who was to give the lion some\nwine like that which was drunk by the king.  The lion said, I will go\nwith him, and see that I get the right wine.  Then he went down with\nthe cup-bearer, and when they were below, the cup-bearer wanted to\ndraw him some of the common wine that was drunk by the king's\nservants, but the lion said, stop, I will taste the wine first, and\nhe drew half a measure, and swallowed it down at one draught.  No,\nsaid he, that is not right.  The cup-bearer looked at him askance,\nbut went on, and was about to give him some out of another barrel\nwhich was for the king's marshal.  The lion said, stop, let me taste\nthe wine first, and drew half a measure and drank it.  That is\nbetter, but still not right, said he.  Then the cup-bearer grew angry\nand said, how can a stupid animal like you understand wine.  But the\nlion gave him a blow behind the ears, which made him fall down by no\nmeans gently, and when he had got up again, he conducted the lion\nquite silently into a little cellar apart, where the king's wine lay,\nfrom which no one ever drank.  The lion first drew half a measure and\ntried the wine, and then he said, that may possibly be the right\nsort, and bade the cup-bearer fill six bottles of it.  And now they\nwent upstairs again, but when the lion came out of the cellar into\nthe open air, he reeled here and there, and was rather drunk, and the\ncup-bearer was forced to carry the wine as far as the door for him,\nand then the lion took the handle of the basket in his mouth, and\ntook it to his master.  The huntsman said, behold, sir host, here\nhave I bread, meat, vegetables, confectionery and wine such as the\nking has, and now I will dine with my animals, and he sat down and\nate and drank, and gave the hare, the fox, the wolf, the bear, and\nthe lion also to eat and to drink, and was joyful, for he saw that\nthe king's daughter still loved him.  And when he had finished his\ndinner, he said, sir host, now have I eaten and drunk, as the king\neats and drinks, and now I will go to the king's court and marry the\nking's daughter.\n\nSaid the host, how can that be, when she already has a betrothed\nhusband, and when the wedding is to be solemnized to-day.  Then the\nhuntsman drew forth the handerchief which the king's daughter had\ngiven him on the dragon's hill, and in which were folded the\nmonster's seven tongues, and said, that which I hold in my hand shall\nhelp me to do it.  Then the innkeeper looked at the handkerchief, and\nsaid, whatever I believe, I do not believe that, and I am willing to\nstake my house and courtyard on it.  The huntsman, however, took a\nbag with a thousand gold pieces, put it on the table, and said, I\nstake that on it.\n\nNow the king said to his daughter, at the royal table, what did all\nthe wild animals want, which have been coming to you, and going in\nand out of my palace.  She replied, I may not tell you, but send and\nhave the master of these animals brought, and you will do well.  The\nking sent a servant to the inn, and invited the stranger, and the\nservant came just as the huntsman had laid his wager with the\ninnkeeper.  Then said he, behold, sir host, now the king sends his\nservant and invites me, but I do not go in this way.\n\nAnd he said to the servant, I request the lord king to send me royal\nclothing, and a carriage with six horses, and servants to attend me.\nWhen the king heard the answer, he said to his daughter, what shall I\ndo.  She said, cause him to be fetched as he desires to be, and you\nwill do well.  Then the king sent royal apparel, a carriage with six\nhorses, and servants to wait on him.  When the huntsman saw them\ncoming, he said, behold, sir host, now I am fetched as I desired to\nbe, and he put on the royal garments, took the handerchief with the\ndragon's tongues with him, and drove off to the king.  When the king\nsaw him coming, he said to his daughter, how shall I receive him.\nShe answered, go to meet him and you will do well.  Then the king\nwent to meet him and led him in, and his animals followed.  The king\ngave him a seat near himself and his daughter, and the marshal, as\nbridegroom, sat on the other side, but no longer knew the huntsman.\nAnd now at this very moment, the seven heads of the dragon were\nbrought in as a spectacle, and the king said, the seven heads were\ncut off the dragon by the marshal, wherefore to-day I give him my\ndaughter to wife.  The the huntsman stood up, opened the seven\nmouths, and said, where are the seven tongues of the dragon.  Then\nwas the marshal terrified, and grew pale and knew not what answer he\nshould make, and at length in his anguish he said, dragons have no\ntongues.  The huntsman said, liars ought to have none, but the\ndragon's tongues are the tokens of the victor, and he unfolded the\nhanderchief, and there lay all seven inside it.  And he put each\ntongue in the mouth to which it belonged, and it fitted exactly.\n\nThen he took the handkerchief on which the name of the princess was\nembroidered, and showed it to the maiden, and asked to whom she had\ngiven it, and she replied, to him who killed the dragon. And then he\ncalled his animals, and took the collar off each of them and the\ngolden clasp from the lion, and showed them to the maiden and asked\nto whom they belonged.  She answered, the necklace and golden clasp\nwere mine, but I divided them among the animals who helped to conquer\nthe dragon.  Then spoke the huntsman, when I, tired of the fight, was\nresting and sleeping, the marshal came and cut off my head.  Then he\ncarried away the king's daughter, and gave out that it was he who had\nkilled the dragon, but that he lied I prove with the tongues, the\nhandkerchief, and the necklace.\n\nAnd then he related how his animals had healed him by means of a\nwonderful root, and how he had traveled about with them for one year,\nand had at length come there and had learnt the treachery of the\nmarshal by the inn-keeper's story.  Then the king asked his daughter,\nis it true that this man killed the dragon.\n\nAnd she answered, yes, it is true.  Now can I reveal the wicked deed\nof the marshal, as it has come to light without my connivance, for he\nwrung from me a promise to be silent.  For this reason, however, did\nI make the condition that the marriage should not be solemnized for a\nyear and a day.  Then the king bade twelve councillors be summoned\nwho were to pronounce judgment on the marshal, and they sentenced him\nto be torn to pieces by four bulls.\n\nThe marshal was therefore executed, but the king gave his daughter to\nthe huntsman, and named him his viceroy over the whole kingdom.  The\nwedding was celebrated with great joy, and the young king caused his\nfather and his foster-father to be brought, and loaded them with\ntreasures.  Neither did he forget the inn-keeper, but sent for him\nand said, behold, sir host, I have married the king's daughter, and\nyour house and yard are mine.\n\nThe host said, yes, according to justice it is so.  But the young\nking said, it shall be done according to mercy, and told him that he\nshould keep his house and yard, and gave him the thousand pieces of\ngold as well.\n\nAnd now the young king and queen were thoroughly happy, and lived in\ngladness together.  He often went out hunting because it was a\ndelight to him, and the faithful animals had to accompany him.  In\nthe neighborhood, however, there was a forest of which it was\nreported that it was haunted, and that whosoever did but enter it did\nnot easily get out again.  But the young king had a great inclination\nto hunt in it, and let the old king have no peace until he allowed\nhim to do so.  So he rode forth with a great following, and when he\ncame to the forest, he saw a snow-white hind, and said to his men,\nwait here until I return, I want to hunt that beautiful creature, and\nhe rode into the forest after it, followed only by his animals.  The\nattendants halted and waited until evening, but he did not return, so\nthey rode home, and told the young queen that the young king had\nfollowed a white hind into the enchanted forest, and had not come\nback again.  Then she was in the greatest concern about him.  He,\nhowever, had still continued to ride on and on after the beautiful\nwild animal, and had never been able to overtake it, when he thought\nhe was near enough to aim, he instantly saw it bound away into the\nfar distance, and at length it vanished altogether.  And now he\nperceived that he had penetrated deep into the forest, and blew his\nhorn but he received no answer, for his attendants could not hear it.\nAnd as night was falling, he saw that he could not get home that day,\nso he dismounted from his horse, lighted himself a fire near a tree,\nand resolved to spend the night by it.  While he was sitting by the\nfire, and his animals also were lying down beside him, it seemed to\nhim that he heard a human voice.  He looked round, but could\nperceived nothing.  Soon afterwards, he again heard a groan as if\nfrom above, and then he looked up, and saw an old woman sitting in\nthe tree, who wailed unceasingly, oh, oh, oh, how cold I am.  Said\nhe, come down, and warm yourself if you are cold.  But she said, no,\nyour animals will bite me.  He answered, they will do you no harm,\nold mother, do come down.  She, however, was a witch, and said, I\nwill throw down a wand from the tree, and if you strike them on the\nback with it, they will do me no harm.  Then she threw him a small\nwand, and he struck them with it, and instantly they lay still and\nwere turned into stone.  And when the witch was safe from the\nanimals, she leapt down and touched him also with a wand, and changed\nhim to stone.  Thereupon she laughed, and dragged him and the animals\ninto a vault, where many more such stones already lay.\n\nAs the young king did not come back at all, the queen's anguish and\ncare grew constantly greater.  And it so happened that at this very\ntime the other brother who had turned to the east when they\nseparated, came into the kingdom.  He had sought a situation, and had\nfound none, and had then traveled about here and there, and had made\nhis animals dance.  Then it came into his mind that he would just go\nand look at the knife that they had thrust in the trunk of a tree at\ntheir parting, that he might learn how his brother was.  When he got\nthere his brother's side of the knife was half rusted, and half\nbright.  Then he was alarmed and thought, a great misfortune must\nhave befallen my brother, but perhaps I can still save him, for half\nthe knife is still bright.  He and his animals traveled towards the\nwest, and when he entered the gate of the town, the guard came to\nmeet him, and asked if he was to announce him to his consort the\nyoung queen, who had for a couple of days been in the greatest sorrow\nabout his staying away, and was afraid he had been killed in the\nenchanted forest.\n\nThe sentries, indeed, thought no otherwise than that he was the young\nking himself, for he looked so like him, and had wild animals running\nbehind him.  Then he saw that they were speaking of his brother, and\nthought, it will be better if I pass myself off for him, and then I\ncan rescue him more easily.  So he allowed himself to be escorted\ninto the castle by the guard, and was received with the greatest joy.\nThe young queen indeed thought that he was her husband, and asked him\nwhy he had stayed away so long.  He answered, I had lost myself in a\nforest, and could not find my way out again any sooner.  At night he\nwas taken to the royal bed, but he laid a two-edged sword between him\nand the young queen, she did not know what that could mean, but did\nnot venture to ask.\n\nHe remained in the palace a couple of days, and in the meantime\ninquired into everything which related to the enchanted forest, and\nat last he said, I must hunt there once more.  The king and the young\nqueen wanted to persuade him not to do it, but he stood out against\nthem, and went forth with a larger following.  When he had got into\nthe forest, it fared with him as with his brother, he saw a white\nhind and said to his men, stay here, and wait until I return, I want\nto chase the lovely wild beast, and then he rode into the forest and\nhis animals ran after him.  But he could not overtake the hind, and\ngot so deep into the forest that he was forced to pass the night\nthere.  And when he had lighted a fire, he heard someone wailing\nabove him, oh, oh, oh, how cold I am.\n\nThen he looked up, and the self-same witch was sitting in the tree.\nSaid he, if you are cold, come down, little old mother, and warm\nyourself.  She answered, no, your animals will bite me. But he said,\nthey will not hurt you.  Then she cried, I will throw down a wand to\nyou, and if you smite them with it they will do me no harm.  When the\nhuntsman heard that, he had no confidence in the old woman, and said,\nI will not strike my animals.  Come down, or I will fetch you.  Then\nshe cried, what do you want.  You shall not touch me.  But he\nreplied, if you do not come, I will shoot you.  Said she, shoot away,\nI do not fear your bullets.\n\nThen he aimed, and fired at her, but the witch was proof against all\nleaden bullets, and laughed shrilly and cried, you shall not hit me.\nThe huntsman knew what to do, tore three silver buttons off his coat,\nand loaded his gun with them, for against them her arts were useless,\nand when he fired she fell down at once with a scream.  Then he set\nhis foot on her and said, old witch, if you do not instantly confess\nwhere my brother is, I will seize you with both my hands and throw\nyou into the fire.  She was in a great fright, begged for mercy and\nsaid, he and his animals lie in a vault, turned to stone.  Then he\ncompelled her to go thither with him, threatened her, and said, old\nsea-cat, now you shall make my brother and all the human beings lying\nhere, alive again, or you shall go into the fire.  She took a wand\nand touched the stones, and then his brother with his animals came to\nlife again, and many others, merchants, artisans, and shepherds,\narose, thanked him for their deliverance, and went to their homes.\nBut when the twin brothers saw each other again, they kissed each\nother and rejoiced with all their hearts.  Then they seized the\nwitch, bound her and laid her on the fire, and when she was burnt the\nforest opened of its own accord, and was light and clear, and the\nking's palace could be seen at about the distance of a three hours,\nwalk.\n\nThereupon the two brothers went home together, and on the way told\neach other their histories.  And when the younger said that he was\nruler of the whole country in the king's stead, the other observed,\nthat I remarked very well, for when I came to the town, and was taken\nfor you, all royal honors were paid me, the young queen looked on me\nas her husband, and I had to eat at her side, and sleep in your bed.\nWhen the other heard that, he became so jealous and angry that he\ndrew his sword, and struck off his brother's head.  But when he saw\nhim lying there dead, and saw his red blood flowing, he repented most\nviolently, my brother delivered me, cried he, and I have killed him\nfor it, and he bewailed him aloud.  Then his hare came and offered to\ngo and bring some of the root of life, and bounded away and brought\nit while yet there was time, and the dead man was brought to life\nagain, and knew nothing about the wound.\n\nAfter this they journeyed onwards, and the younger said, you look\nlike me, you have royal apparel on as I have, and the animals follow\nyou as they do me, we will go in by opposite gates, and arrive at the\nsame time from the two sides in the aged king's presence.  So they\nseparated, and at the same time came the watchmen from the one door\nand from the other, and announced that the young king and the animals\nhad returned from the chase.\n\nThe king said, it is not possible, the gates lie quite a mile apart.\nIn the meantime, however, the two brothers entered the courtyard of\nthe palace from opposite sides, and both mounted the steps. Then the\nking said to the daughter, say which is your husband.\n\nEach of them looks exactly like the other, I cannot tell.  Then she\nwas in great distress, and could not tell, but at last she remembered\nthe necklace which she had given to the animals, and she sought for\nand found her little golden clasp on the lion, and she cried in her\ndelight, he who is followed by this lion is my true husband.  Then\nthe young king laughed and said, yes, he is the right one, and they\nsat down together to table, and ate and drank, and were merry.  At\nnight when the young king went to bed, his wife said, why have you\nfor these last nights always laid a two-edged sword in our bed.  I\nthought you had a wish to kill me.  Then he knew how true his brother\nhad been.\n\n"
