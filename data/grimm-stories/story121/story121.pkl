S"A woman has a lazy daughter who will not spin. She beats her daughter so that her cries are heard by a queen. The queen asks the mother why she is beating her daughter. The mother claims it is because her daughter won't stop spinning. The queen begs the daughter to be allowed to come to the palace and spin for her. The girl is taken to the palace where she is shown three rooms full of flax. After the girl has spun all of this flax, she will be allowed to marry the queen's son. Three strange women one, with a broad, flat foot, one a drooping lip, and one an oversized thumb offer to do the spinning if she will invite them to her wedding.

S"There was once a girl who was idle and would not spin, and\nlet her mother say what she would, she could not bring her\nto it.  At last the mother was once so overcome with anger\nand impatience, that she beat her, at which the girl began\nto weep loudly.  Now at this very moment the queen drove by,\nand when she heard the weeping she stopped her carriage, went\ninto the house and asked the mother why she was beating her\ndaughter so that the cries could be heard out on the road.  Then\nthe woman was ashamed to reveal the laziness of her daughter\nand said, I cannot get her to leave off spinning.  She insists\non spinning for ever and ever, and I am poor, and cannot\nprocure the flax.  Then\nanswered the queen, there is nothing that I like better to hear\nthan spinning, and I am never happier than when the wheels are\nhumming.  Let me have your daughter with me in the palace.  I\nhave flax enough, and there she shall spin as much as she likes.\nThe mother was heartily satisfied with this, and the queen\ntook the girl with her.  When they had arrived at the palace,\nshe led her up into three rooms which were filled from the\nbottom to the top with the finest flax.  Now spin me this flax,\nsaid she, and when you have done it, you shall have my eldest\nson for a husband, even if you are poor.  I care not for that,\nyour untiring industry is dowry enough.  The girl was secretly\nterrified, for she could not have spun the flax, no, not if\nshe had lived till she was three hundred years old, and had\nsat at it every day from morning till night.  When therefore she\nwas alone, she began to weep, and sat thus for three days\nwithout moving a finger.  On the third day came the queen, and\nwhen she saw that nothing had yet been spun, she was surprised,\nbut the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able\nto begin because of her great distress at leaving her mother's\nhouse.  The queen was satisfied with this, but said when she was\ngoing away, tomorrow you must begin to work.\nWhen the girl was alone again, she did not know what to do, and\nin her distress went to the window.  Then she saw three women\ncoming towards her, the first of whom had a broad flat foot, the\nsecond had such a great underlip that it hung down over her chin,\nand the third had a broad thumb.  They remained standing before\nthe window, looked up, and asked the girl what was amiss with\nher.  She complained of her trouble, and then they offered\nher their help and said, if you will invite us to the wedding,\nnot be ashamed of us, and will call us your aunts, and likewise\nwill place us at your table, we will spin up the flax for you,\nand that in a very short time.  With all my heart, she replied,\ndo but come in and begin the work at once.  Then she let in the\nthree strange women, and cleared a place in the first room,\nwhere they seated themselves and began their spinning.  The one\ndrew the thread and trod the wheel, the other wetted the thread,\nthe third twisted it, and struck the table\nwith her finger, and as often as she struck it, a skein of\nthread fell to the ground that was spun in the finest manner\npossible.  The girl concealed the three spinners from the queen,\nand showed her whenever she came the great quantity of spun\nthread, until the latter could not praise her enough.  When\nthe first room was empty she went to the second, and at last to\nthe third, and that too was quickly cleared.  Then the three women\ntook leave and said to the girl, do not forget what you have\npromised us - it will make your fortune.\nWhen the maiden showed the queen the empty rooms, and the great\nheap of yarn, she gave orders for the wedding, and the bridegroom\nrejoiced that he was to have such a clever and industrious wife,\nand praised her mightily.  I have three aunts, said the girl,\nand as they have been very kind to me, I should not like to\nforget them in my good fortune, allow me to invite them to the\nwedding, and let them sit with us at table.  The queen and the\nbridegroom said, why should we not allow that.  Therefore when\nthe feast began, the three women entered in strange apparel, and\nthe bride said, welcome, dear aunts.  Ah, said the bridegroom,\nhow do you come by these odious friends.  Thereupon he went to\nthe one with the broad flat foot, and said, how do you come by\nsuch a broad foot.  By treading, she answered, by treading.  Then\nthe bridegroom went to the second, and said, how do you come by\nyour falling lip.  By licking, she answered, by licking.  Then\nhe asked the third, how do you come by your broad thumb.  By\ntwisting the thread, she answered, by twisting the thread.  On\nthis the king's son was alarmed and said, neither now nor ever\nshall my beautiful bride touch a spinning-wheel.  And thus she\ngot rid of the hateful flax-spinning.\n"
