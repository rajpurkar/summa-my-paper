S"A poor wood-cutter lived with his wife and three daughters in\na little hut on the edge of a lonely forest.  One morning as he\nwas about to go to his work, he said to his wife, let our\neldest daughter bring me my dinner into the forest, or I shall\nnever get my work done, and in order that she may not miss\nher way, he added, I will take a bag of millet with me and strew\nthe seeds on the path.  When, therefore, the sun was just above\nthe centre of the forest, the girl set out on her way with a\nbowl of soup, but the field-sparrows, and wood-sparrows,\nlarks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked up the\nmillet long before, and the girl could not find the track.\nTrusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and\nnight began to fall.  The trees rustled in the darkness, the\nowls hooted, and she began to be afraid.  Then in the distance she\nperceived a light which glimmered between the trees.  There\nought to be some people living there, who can take me in for the\nnight,\nthought she, and went up to the light.  It was not long before\nshe came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up.  She\nknocked, and a rough voice from inside cried, come in.  The\ngirl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of\nthe room.  Just come in, cried the voice, and when she opened the\ndoor, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the table, supporting\nhis face with both hands, and his white beard fell down over\nthe table almost as far as the ground.  By the stove lay three\nanimals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow.  The girl told her\nstory to the old man, and begged for shelter for the night.  The\nman said,\n               my pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nDuks, answered the animals, and that must have meant, we are\nwilling, for the old man said, here you shall have shelter\nand food, go to the fire, and cook us our supper.  The girl\nfound in the kitchen abundance of everything, and cooked a\ngood supper, but had no thought of the animals.  She carried\nthe full bowl to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man,\nate and satisfied her hunger.  When she had had enough, she said,\nbut now I am tired, where is there a bed in which I can lie down,\nand sleep.  The animals replied,\n               thou hast eaten with him,\n               thou hast drunk with him,\n               thou hast had no thought for us,\n               so find out for thyself where thou canst pass the\n               night.\nThen said the old man, just go upstairs, and you will find a\nroom with two beds, shake them up, and put white linen on them,\nand then I, too, will come and lie down to sleep.  The girl\nwent up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets\non, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for\nthe old man.  After some time the gray-haired man came, held his\ncandle over the girl and shook his head.  When he saw that she\nhad fallen into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her\ndown into the cellar.\nLate at night, the wood-cutter came home, and reproached his\nwife for leaving him to hunger all day.  It is not my fault,\nshe replied, the girl went out with your dinner, and must have\nlost herself, but surely she will come back to-morrow.  The\nwood-cutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the forest, and\nrequested that the second daughter should take him his dinner\nthat day.  I will take a bag with lentils, said he, the seeds\nare larger than millet, the girl will see them better, and\ncan't lose her way.  At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took\nout the food, but the lentils had disappeared.  The birds of the\nforest had picked them up as they had done the day before,\nand had left none.  The girl wandered about in the forest\nuntil night, and then she too reached the house of the old man,\nwas told to go in, and begged for food and a bed.  The man with\nthe white beard again asked the animals,\n               my pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nThe animals again replied 'duks, and everything happened just\nas it had happened the day before.  The girl cooked a good meal,\nate and drank with the old man, and did not concern herself about\nthe animals, and when she inquired about her bed they answered,\n               thou hast eaten with him,\n               thou hast drunk with him,\n               thou hast had no thought for us,\n               so find out for thyself where thou canst pass\n               the night.\nWhen she was asleep the old man came, looked at her, shook his\nhead, and let her down into the cellar.\nOn the third morning the wood-cutter said to his wife, send our\nyoungest child out with my dinner to-day, she has always been good\nand obedient, and will stay in the right path, and not rove about\nlike her sisters, the wild bumble-bees.  The mother did not\nwant to do it, and said, am I to lose my dearest child, as well.\nHave no fear, he replied, the girl will not go astray.  She is\ntoo prudent and sensible.  Besides I will take some peas with me,\nstrew them about.  They are still larger than lentils, and will\nshow her the way.  But when the girl went out with her basket on\nher arm, the wood-pigeons had already got all the peas in their\ncrops, and she did not know which way she was to turn.  She was\nfull of sorrow and never ceased to think how hungry her father\nwould be, and how her good mother would grieve, if she did\nnot go home.  At length when it grew dark, she saw the light and\ncame to the house in the forest.  She begged quite prettily to\nbe allowed to spend the night there, and the man with the white\nbeard again asked his animals,\n               my pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nDuks, said they.  Then the girl went to the stove where the\nanimals were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked\ntheir smooth feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled\ncow between her horns, and when, in obedience to the old man's\norders, she had made ready some good soup, and the bowl was\nplaced upon the table, she said, am I to eat as much as I want,\nand the good animals to have nothing.  Outside is food in plenty,\nI will look after them first.  So she went and brought some\nbarley and stewed it for the cock and hen, and a whole armful\nof sweet-smelling hay for the cow.  I hope you will like it,\ndear animals, said she, and you shall have a refreshing draught\nin case you are thirsty.  Then she fetched a bucketful of water,\nand the cock and hen jumped on to the edge of it and dipped\ntheir beaks in, and then held up their heads as the birds do when\nthey drink, and the brindled cow also took a hearty draught.  When\nthe animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by\nthe old man, and ate what he had left.  It was not long before\nthe cock and the hen began to thrust their heads beneath\ntheir wings, and the eyes of the cow likewise began to blink.\nThen said the girl, ought we not to go to bed.\n               My pretty hen,\n               my pretty cock,\n               my pretty brindled cow,\n               what are you saying now.\nThe animals answered, duks,\n               thou hast eaten with us,\n               thou hast drunk with us,\n               thou hast had kind thought for all of us,\n               we wish thee good-night.\nThen the maiden went upstairs, shook the feather-beds, and laid\nclean sheets on them, and when she had done it the old man came\nand lay down in one of the beds, and his white beard reached down\nto his feet.  The girl lay down on the other, said her prayers,\nand fell asleep.\n\nShe slept quietly till midnight, and then there was such a noise\nin the house that she awoke.  There was a sound of cracking and\nsplitting in every corner, and the doors sprang open, and beat\nagainst the walls.  The beams groaned as if they were being torn\nout of their joints, it seemed as if the staircase were falling\ndown, and at length there was a crash as if the entire roof had\nfallen in.  When, however, all grew quiet once more, and the girl\nwas not hurt, she stayed quietly lying where she was, and fell\nasleep again.  But when she woke up in the morning with the\nbrilliancy of the sunshine, what did her eyes behold.  She was\nlying in a vast hall, and everything around her shone with royal\nsplendor.  On the walls, golden flowers grew up on a ground of\ngreen silk, the bed was of ivory, and the canopy of red velvet,\nand on a chair close by, was a pair of slippers embroidered\nwith pearls.  The girl believed that she was in a dream, but\nthree richly clad attendants came in, and asked what orders she\nwould like to give.  If you will go, she replied, I will get up\nat once and make ready some soup for the old man, and then I\nwill feed the pretty hen, and the pretty cock, and the pretty\nbrindled cow.  She thought the old man was up already, and looked\nround at his bed.  He, however, was not lying in it, but a\nstranger.\n\nAnd while she was looking at him, and becoming aware that he was\nyoung and handsome, he awoke, sat up in bed, and said, I am\na king's son, and was bewitched by a wicked witch, and made to\nlive in this forest, as an old gray-haired man.  No one was\nallowed to be with me but my three attendants in the form\nof a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow.  The spell was not to be\nbroken until a girl came to us whose heart was so good that she\nshowed herself full of love, not only towards mankind, but towards\nanimals - and that you have done, and by you at midnight we were\nset free, and the old hut in the forest was changed back again\ninto my royal palace.  And when they had arisen, the king's son\nordered the three attendants to set out and fetch the father and\nmother of the girl to the marriage feast.  But where are my two\nsisters, inquired the maiden.  I have locked them in the cellar,\nand to-morrow they shall be led into the forest, and shall live\nas servants to a charcoal-burner, until they have grown kinder,\nand do not leave poor animals to suffer hunger.\n"
