A hen and a cock go to a nut hill to find nuts. Instead of sharing the nut she finds, the hen eats the entire nut by herself. It becomes stuck in her throat and her husband goes to fetch some water. By the time the cock has gotten the water, the hen has died. The cock's cries attract a group of animal and together they prepare to bury the hen. The procession reaches a stream. They attempt to cross the stream and the entire party, with the exception of the cock and dead hen, fall into the water and are drowned. The cock is left to bury the hen on his own.
