S"There was once upon a time an old queen whose husband had been dead\nfor many years, and she had a beautiful daughter.  When the princess\ngrew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance.\nWhen the time came for her to be married, and she had to journey\nforth into the distant kingdom, the aged queen packed up for her many\ncostly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and\nsilver, and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained\nto a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart.\n\nShe likewise sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to ride with her, and\nhand her over to the bridegroom, and each had a horse for the\njourney, but the horse of the king's daughter was called falada, and\ncould speak.  So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother\nwent into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it\nuntil it bled.  Then she held a white handkerchief to it into which\nshe let three drops of blood fall, gave it to her daughter and said,\ndear child, preserve this carefully, it will be of service to you on\nyour way.\n\nSo they took a sorrowful leave of each other, the princess put the\npiece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to\nher bridegroom.  After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning\nthirst, and said to her waiting-maid, dismount, and take my cup which\nyou have brought with you for me, and get me some water from the\nstream, for I should like to drink.  If you are thirsty, said the\nwaiting-maid, get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink out\nof the water, I don't choose to be your servant.\n\nSo in her great thirst the princess alighted, bent down over the\nwater in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of\nthe golden cup.  Then she said, ah, heaven, and the three drops of\nblood answered, if this your mother knew, her heart would break in\ntwo.  But the king's daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted\nher horse again.\n\nShe rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched\nher, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to a stream of\nwater, she again cried to her waiting-maid, dismount, and give me\nsome water in my golden cup, for she had long ago forgotten the\ngirl's ill words.  But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily, if\nyou wish to drink, get it yourself, I don't choose to be your maid.\nThen in her great thirst the king's daughter alighted, bent over the\nflowing stream, wept and said, ah, heaven, and the drops of blood\nagain replied, if this your mother knew, her heart would break in\ntwo.\n\nAnd as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the\nhandkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and\nfloated away with the water without her observing it, so great was\nher trouble.  The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she\nrejoiced to think that she had now power over the bride, for since\nthe princess had lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and\npowerless.\n\nSo now when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was\ncalled falada, the waiting-maid said, falada is more suitable for me,\nand my nag will do for you, and the princess had to be content with\nthat.  Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess\nexchange her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes, and at length\nshe was compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would\nnot say one word of this to anyone at the royal court, and if she had\nnot taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot.  But\nfalada saw all this, and observed it well.\n\nThe waiting-maid now mounted falada, and the true bride the bad\nhorse, and thus they traveled onwards, until at length they entered\nthe royal palace.  There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and\nthe prince sprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from\nher horse, and thought she was his consort.\n\nShe was conducted upstairs, but the real princess was left standing\nbelow.  Then the old king looked out of the window and saw her\nstanding in the courtyard, and noticed how dainty and delicate and\nbeautiful she was, and instantly went to the royal apartment, and\nasked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down\nbelow in the courtyard, and who she was.  I picked her up on my way\nfor a companion, give the girl something to work at, that she may not\nstand idle.\n\nBut the old king had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said, I\nhave a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him.  The boy was\ncalled conrad, and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese.\nSoon afterwards the false bride said to the young king, dearest\nhusband, I beg you to do me a favor.  He answered, I will do so most\nwillingly.  Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horse\non which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way. In reality,\nshe was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the\nking's daughter.\n\nThen she succeeded in making the king promise that it should be done,\nand the faithful falada was to die, this came to the ears of the real\nprincess, and she secretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of\ngold if he would perform a small service for her.  There was a great\ndark-looking gateway in the town, through which morning and evening\nshe had to pass with the geese, would he be so goood as to nail up\nfalada's head on it, so that she might see him again, more than once.\nThe knacker's man promised to do that, and cut off the head, and\nnailed it fast beneath the dark gateway.\n\nEarly in the morning, when she and conrad drove out their flock\nbeneath this gateway, she said in passing,\n          alas, falada, hanging there.\n\nThen the head answered,\n          alas, young queen, how ill you fare.\n          If this your mother knew,\n          her heart would break in two.\n\nThen they went still further out of the town, and drove their geese\ninto the country.  And when they had come to the meadow, she sat down\nand unbound her hair which was like pure gold, and conrad saw it and\ndelighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs.\nThen she said,\n          blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,\n          blow conrad's little hat away,\n          and make him chase it here and there,\n          until I have braided all my hair,\n          and bound it up again.\n\nAnd there came such a violent wind that it blew conrad's hat far away\nacross country, and he was forced to run after it. When he came back\nshe had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again, and he\ncould not get any of it.  Then conrad was angry, and would not speak\nto her, and thus they watched the geese until the evening, and then\nthey went home. Next day when they were driving the geese out through\nthe dark gateway, the maiden said,\n          alas, falada, hanging there.\n\nFalada answered,\n          alas, young queen, how ill you fare.\n          If this your mother knew,\n          her heart would break in two.\n\nAnd she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair,\nand conrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste,\n          blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,\n          blow conrad's little hat away,\n          and make him chase it here and there,\n          until I have braided all my hair,\n          and bound it up again.\n\nThen the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far\naway, and conrad was forced to run after it, and when he came back,\nher hair had been put up a long time, and he could get none of it,\nand so they looked after their geese till evening came.\n\nBut in the evening after they had got home, conrad went to the old\nking, and said, I won't tend the geese with that girl any longer.\nWhy not, inquired the aged king.  Oh, because she vexes me the whole\nday long.  Then the aged king commanded him to relate what it was\nthat she did to him.  And conrad said, in the morning when we pass\nbeneath the dark gateway with the block, there is a horse's head on\nthe wall, and she says to it,\n          alas, falada, hanging there.\n\nAnd the head replies,\n          alas, young queen how ill you fare.\n          If this your mother knew,\n          her heart would break in two.\n\nAnd conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture, and\nhow when there he had to chase his hat.\n\nThe aged king commanded him to drive his block out again next day,\nand as soon as morning came, he placed himself behind the dark\ngateway, and heard how the maiden spoke to the head of falada, and\nthen he too went into the country, and hid himself in the thicket in\nthe meadow.  There he soon saw with his own eyes the goose-girl and\nthe goose-boy bringing their flock, and how after a while she sat\ndown and unplaited her hair, which shone with radiance.  And soon she\nsaid,\n          blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say,\n          blow conrad's little hat away,\n          and make him chase it here and there,\n          until I have braided all my hair,\n          and bound it up again.\n\nThen came a blast of wind and carried off conrad's hat, so that he\nhad to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and\nplaiting her hair, all of which the king observed.  Then, quite\nunseen, he went away, and when the goose-girl came home in the\nevening, he called her aside, and asked why she did all these things.\nI may not tell that, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human\nbeing, for I have sworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me,\nif I had not done that, I should have lost my life.\n\nHe urged her and left her no peace, but he could draw nothing from\nher.  Then said he, if you will not tell me anything, tell your\nsorrows to the iron-stove there, and he went away.  Then she crept\ninto the iron-stove, and began to weep and lament, and emptied her\nwhole heart, and said, here am I deserted by the whole world, and yet\nI am a king's daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by force brought\nme to such a pass that I have been compelled to put off my royal\napparel, and she has taken my place with my bridegroom, and I have to\nperform menial service as a goose-girl if this my mother knew, her\nheart would break in two.\n\nThe aged king, however, was standing outside by the pipe of the\nstove, and was listening to what she said, and heard it. Then he came\nback again, and bade her come out of the stove. And royal garments\nwere placed on her, and it was marvellous how beautiful she was.  The\naged king summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got the\nfalse bride who was only a waiting-maid, but that the true one was\nstanding there, as the former goose-girl.  The young king rejoiced\nwith all his heart when he saw her beauty and youth, and a great\nfeast was made ready to which all the people and all good friends\nwere invited.\n\nAt the head of the table sat the bridegroom with the king's daughter\nat one side of him, and the waiting-maid on the other, but the\nwaiting-maid was blinded, and did not recognize the princess in her\ndazzling array.  When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the\naged king asked the waiting-maid as a riddle, what punishment a\nperson deserved who had behaved in such and such a way to her master,\nand at the same time related the whole story, and asked what sentence\nsuch a person merited.  Then the false bride said, she deserves no\nbetter fate than to be stripped entirely naked, and put in a barrel\nwhich is studded inside with pointed nails, and two white horses\nshould be harnessed to it, which will drag her along through one\nstreet after another, till she is dead.\n\nIt is you, said the aged king, and you have pronounced your own\nsentence, and thus shall it be done unto you.  And when the sentence\nhad been carried out, the young king married his true bride, and both\nof them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness.\n\n"
