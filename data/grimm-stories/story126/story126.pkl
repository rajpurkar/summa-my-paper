S"Hard by a great forest dwelt a wood-cutter with his wife, who had an\nonly child, a little girl three years old.  They were so poor,\nhowever, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to\nget food for her.  One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully\nto his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly\nthere stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of\nshining stars on her head, who said to him 'I am the virgin mary,\nmother of the child jesus. You are poor and needy, bring your child\nto me, I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her.'\nThe wood-cutter obeyed, brought his child, and gave her to the virgin\nmary, who took her up to heaven with her.  There the child fared\nwell, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of\ngold, and the little angels played with her.  And when she was\nfourteen years of age, the virgin mary called her one day and said\n'dear child, I am about to make a long journey, so take into your\nkeeping the keys of the thirteen doors of heaven.  Twelve of these\nyou may open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the\nthirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden you.  Take\ncare not to open it, or you will be unhappy.' The girl promised to be\nobedient, and when the virgin mary was gone, she began to examine the\ndwellings of the kingdom of heaven.  Each day she opened one of them,\nuntil she had made the round of the twelve. In each of them sat one\nof the apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in\nall the magnificence and splendor, and the little angels who always\naccompanied her rejoiced with her. Then the forbidden door alone\nremained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden\nbehind it, and said to the angels 'I will not open it entirely, and I\nwill not go inside, but I will unlock it so that we can see just a\nlittle through the opening.' 'Oh'no,  said the little angels,  'that\nwould be a sin.  The virgin mary has forbidden it, and it might\neasily cause your unhappiness.' Then she was silent, but the desire\nin her heart was not stilled, but gnawed there and tormented her, and\nlet her have no rest.  And once when the angels had all gone out, she\nthought 'now I am quite alone, and I could peep in.  If I do, no one\nwill ever know.' She sought out the key, and when she had got it in\nher hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she\nturned it round as well.  Then the door sprang open, and she saw\nthere the trinity sitting in fire and splendor.  She stayed there\nawhile, and looked at everything in amazement, then she touched the\nlight a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden.\nImmediately a great fear fell on her.  She shut the door violently,\nand ran hi there.  But her terror would not quit her, let her do what she\n'Yes,  said the girl, for the second time. Then she perceived the\nfinger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and\nsaw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time 'have\nyou not done it.' 'No,  said the girl for the third time.  Then said\nthe virgin mary 'you have not obeyed me, and besides that you have\nlied, you are no longer worthy to be in heaven.' Then the girl fell\ninto a deep sleep, and when she awoke she lay on the earth below, and\nin the midst of a wilderness.  She wanted to cry out, but she could\nbring forth no sound.  She sprang up and wanted to run away, but\nwhithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by\nthick hedges of thorns through which she could not break.  In the\ndesert, in which she was imprisoned, there stood an old hollow tree,\nand this had to be her dwelling-place.  Into this she crept when\nnight came, and here she slept.  Here, too, she found a shelter from\nmight, and her heart beat continually and would not be still, the gold too\nstayed on her finger, and  would not go away, let  her rub it and wash  it\nnever so much. It was not long  before the virgin mary came back from  her\njourney.  She called the girl  before her, and asked  to have the keys  of\nheaven back.  When the maiden gave  her the bunch, the virgin looked  into\nher eyes and said 'have you not opened the thirteenth door also.' 'No, she\nreplied.  Then she laid her hand on the girl's heart, and felt how it beat\nand beat, and  saw right well  that she  had disobeyed her  order and  had\nopened the door.  Then she said once again 'are you certain that you  have\nnot done it.'\nstorm and rain, but it was a miserable life, and bitterly did she\nweep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven, and how\nthe angels had played with her.  Roots and wild berries were her only\nfood, and for these she sought as far as she could go.  In the autumn\nshe picked up the fallen nuts and leaves, and carried them into the\nhole.  The nuts were her food in winter, and when snow and ice came,\nshe crept amongst the leaves like a poor little animal that she might\nnot freeze.  Before long her clothes were all torn, and one bit of\nthem after another fell off her.  As soon, however, as the sun shone\nwarm again, she went out and sat in front of the tree, and her long\nhair covered her on all sides like a mantle.  Thus she sat year after\nyear, and felt the pain and the misery of the world. One day, when\nthe trees were once more clothed in fresh green, the king of the\ncountry was hunting in the forest, and followed a roe, and as it had\nfled into the thicket which shut in this part of the forest, he got\noff his horse, tore the bushes asunder, and cut himself a path with\nhis sword.  When he had at last forced his way through, he saw a\nwonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree, and she sat\nthere and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very\nfeet. He stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he\nspoke to her and said 'who are you.  Why are you sitting here in the\nwilderness.' But she gave no answer, for she could not open her\nmouth.  The king continued 'will you go with me to my castle.  Then\nshe just nodded her head a little.  The king took her in his arms,\ncarried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached\nthe royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments,\nand gave her all things in abundance.  Although she could not speak,\nshe was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her\nwith all his heart, and it was not long before he married her. After\na year or so had passed, the queen brought a son into the world.\nThereupon the virgin mary appeared to her in the night when she lay\nin her bed alone, and said 'if you will tell the truth and confess\nthat you did unlock the forbidden door, I will open your mouth and\ngive you back your speech, but if you persevere in your sin, and deny\nobstinately, I will take your new-born child away with me.' The the\nqueen was permitted to answer, but she remained hard, and said 'no, I\ndid not open the forbidden door, and the virgin mary took the\nnew-born child from her arms, and vanished with it.  Next morning\nwhen the child was not to be found, it was whispered among the people\nthat the queen was a man-eater, and had put her own child to death.\nShe heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary, but the\nking would not believe it, for he loved her so much. When a year had\ngone by the queen again bore a son, and in the night the virgin mary\nagain came to her, and said 'if you will confess that you opened the\nforbidden door, I will give you your child back and untie your tongue\nbut if you continue in sin and deny it, I will take away with me this\nnew child also.' Then the queen again said 'no, I did not open the\nforbidden door.' And the virgin took the child out of her arms, and\naway with her to heaven.  Next morning, when this child also had\ndisappeared, the people declared quite loudly that the queen had\ndevoured it, and the king's councillors demanded that she should be\nbrought to justice.  The king however, loved her so dearly that he\nwould not believe it, and commanded the councillors under pain of\ndeath not to say any more about it. The following year the queen gave\nbirth to a beautiful little daughter, and for the third time the\nvirgin mary appeared to her in the night and said 'follow me.' She\ntook the queen by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her\nthere her two eldest children, who smiled at her, and were playing\nwith the ball of the world.  When the queen rejoiced thereat, the\nvirgin mary said 'is your heart not yet softened.  If you will own\nthat you opened the forbidden door, I will give you back your two\nlittle sons.' But for the third time the queen answered 'no, I did\nnot open the forbidden door.' Then the virgin let her sink down to\nearth once more, and took from her likewise her third child.\n\nNext morning, when the loss was reported abroad, all the people cried\nloudly 'the queen is a man-eater.  She must be judged, and the king\nwas no longer able to restrain his councillors. Thereupon a trial was\nheld, and as she could not answer, and defend herself, she was\ncondemned to be burnt at the stake. The wood was got together, and\nwhen she was fast bound to the stake, and the fire began to burn\nround about her, the hard ice of pride melted, her heart was moved by\nrepentance, and she thought 'if I could but confess before my death\nthat I opened the door.' Then her voice came back to her, and she\ncried out loudly 'yes, mary, I did it, and straight-way rain fell\nfrom the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke\nforth above her, and the virgin mary descended with the two little\nsons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms.  She spoke\nkindly to her, and said 'he who repents his sin and acknowledges it,\nis forgiven.' Then she gave her the three children, untied her\ntongue, and granted her happiness for her whole life.\n\n"
