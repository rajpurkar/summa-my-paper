S"\tSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\nOnce upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of\nsnow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at\na window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black\nebony.  And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window\nat the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three\ndrops of blood fell upon the snow.  And the red looked pretty\nupon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had\na child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the\nwood of the window-frame.\n\nSoon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as\nsnow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony,\nand she was therefore called little snow-white.  And when the\nchild was born, the queen died.\n\nAfter a year had passed the king took to himself another wife.\nShe was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could\nnot bear that anyone else chould surpass her in beauty.  She\nhad a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it\nand looked at herself in it, and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThe looking-glass answered,\n          thou, o queen, art the fairest of all.\n\nThen she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke\nthe truth.\n\nBut snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful,\nand when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day,\nand more beautiful than the queen herself.  And once when the\nqueen asked her looking-glass,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nIt answered,\n          thou art fairer than all who are here, lady queen.\n          But more beautiful still is snow-white, as I ween.\n\nThen the queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with\nenvy.  From that hour, whenever she looked at snow-white, her\nheart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much.\nAnd envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a\nweed, so that she had no peace day or night.  She called a\nhuntsman, and said, take the child away into the forest.  I will\nno longer have her in my sight.  Kill her, and bring me back her\nlung and liver as a token.  The huntsman obeyed, and took her away\nbut when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce\nsnow-white's innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, ah dear\nhuntsman, leave me my life.  I will run away into the wild forest,\nand never come home again.\n\nAnd as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and\nsaid, run away, then, you poor child.  The wild beasts will soon\nhave devoured you, thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had\nbeen rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for\nhim to kill her.  And as a young bear just then came running by\nhe stabbed it, and cut out its lung and liver and took them to the\nqueen as proof that the child was dead.  The cook had to salt them,\nand the wicked queen ate them, and thought she had eaten the lung\nand liver of snow-white.\n\nBut now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so\nterrified that she looked at all the leaves on the trees, and did\nnot know what to do.  Then she began to run, and ran over sharp\nstones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but\ndid her no harm.\n\nShe ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening,\nthen she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself.\nEverything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than\ncan be told.  There was a table on which was a white cover, and\nseven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon, moreover,\nthere were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs.\nAgainst the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and\ncovered with snow-white counterpanes.\n\nLittle snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some\nvegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine\nout of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.\nThen, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the\nlittle beds, but none of them suited her, one was too long,\nanother too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was\nright, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to\nsleep.\n\nWhen it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back.\nThey were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for\nore.  They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within\nthe cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything\nwas not in the same order in which they had left it.\n\nThe first said, who has been sitting on my chair.\nThe second, who has been eating off my plate.\nThe third, who has been taking some of my bread.\nThe fourth, who has been eating my vegetables.\nThe fifth, who has been using my fork.\nThe sixth, who has been cutting with my knife.\nThe seventh, who has been drinking out of my mug.\n\nThen the first looked round and saw that there was a little\nhollow on his bed, and he said, who has been getting into my\nbed.  The others came up and each called out, somebody has been\nlying in my bed too.  But the seventh when he looked at his bed\nsaw little snow-white, who was lying asleep therein.  And he\ncalled the others, who came running up, and they cried out with\nastonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the\nlight fall on little snow-white.  Oh, heavens, oh, heavens, cried\nthey, what a lovely child.  And they were so glad that they did\nnot wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed.  And the\nseventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and\nso passed the night.\n\nWhen it was morning little snow-white awoke, and was frightened\nwhen she saw the seven dwarfs.  But they were friendly and asked\nher what her name was.  My name is snow-white, she answered.\nHow have you come to our house, said the dwarfs.  Then she told\nthem that her step-mother had wished to have her killed, but\nthat the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run for\nthe whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.\n\nThe dwarfs said, if you will take care of our house, cook, make\nthe beds, wash, sew and knit, and if you will keep everything neat\nand clean you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing.\nYes, said snow-white, with all my heart.  And she stayed with\nthem.  She kept the house in order for them.  In the mornings\nthey went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the\nevenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready.\nThe girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her\nand said, beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you\nare here, be sure to let no one come in.\n\nBut the queen, believing that she had eaten snow-white's lung and\nliver, could not but think that she was again the first and most\nbeautiful of all, and she went to her looking-glass and said,\nlooking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd the glass answered,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nThen she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass\nnever spoke falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed\nher, and that little snow-white was still alive.\n\nAnd so she thought and thought again how she might kill her,\nfor so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let\nher have no rest.  And when she had at last thought of something\nto do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old\npedlar-woman, and no one could have known her.  In this disguise\nshe went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, and\nknocked at the door and cried, pretty things to sell, very cheap,\nvery cheap.  Little snow-white looked out of the window and called\nout, good-day my good woman, what have you to sell.  Good things,\npretty things, she answered, stay-laces of all colors, and she\npulled out one which was woven of bright-colored silk.  I may let\nthe worthy old woman in, thought snow-white, and she unbolted the\ndoor and bought the pretty laces.  Child, said the old woman,\nwhat a fright you look, come, I will lace you properly for once.\nSnow-white had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself\nbe laced with the new laces.  But the old woman laced so quickly\nand so tightly that snow-white lost her breath and fell down as\nif dead.  Now I am the most beautiful, said the queen to herself,\nand ran away.\n\nNot long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home,\nbut how shocked they were when they saw their dear little snow-white\nlying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor\nmoved, and seemed to be dead.  They lifted her up, and, as they\nsaw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces, then she\nbegan to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again.\nWhen the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, the old\npedlar-woman was no one\nelse than the wicked queen, take care and let no one come in\nwhen we are not with you.\n\nBut the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front\nof the glass and asked,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd it answered as before,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nWhen she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear,\nfor she saw plainly that little snow-white was again alive.\nBut now, she said, I will think of something that shall really\nput an end to you.  And by the help of witchcraft, which she\nunderstood, she made a poisonous comb.  Then she disguised\nherself and took the shape of another old woman.  So she went\nover the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the\ndoor, and cried, good things to sell, cheap, cheap.  Little\nsnow-white looked out and said, go away, I cannot let anyone come\nin.  I suppose you can look, said the old woman, and pulled the\npoisonous comb out and held it up.  It pleased the girl so well\nthat she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door.  When they\nhad made a bargain the old woman said, now I will comb you\nproperly for once.  Poor little snow-white had no suspicion, and\nlet the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the\ncomb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl\nfell down senseless.  You paragon of beauty, said the wicked\nwoman, you are done for now, and she went away.\n\nBut fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs\ncame home.  When they saw snow-white lying as if dead upon the\nground they at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked\nand found the poisoned comb.  Scarcely had they taken it out when\nsnow-white came to herself, and told them what had happened.\nThen they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open\nthe door to no one.\n\nThe queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThen it answered as before,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nWhen she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook\nwith rage.  Snow-white shall die, she cried, even if it costs me\nmy life.\n\nThereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no\none ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple.\nOutside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that\neveryone who saw it longed for it, but whoever ate a piece of it\nmust surely die.\n\nWhen the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself\nup as a farmer's wife, and so she went over the seven\nmountains to the seven dwarfs.  She knocked at the door.  Snow-white\nput her head out of the window and said, I cannot let\nanyone in, the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.  It is all the\nsame to me, answered the woman, I shall soon get rid of my apples.\nThere, I will give you one.\n\nNo, said snow-white, I dare not take anything.  Are you afraid\nof poison, said the old woman, look, I will cut the apple in two\npieces, you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.  The\napple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was\npoisoned.  Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw\nthat the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and\nstretched out\nher hand and took the poisonous half.  But hardly had she a bit\nof it in her mouth than she fell down dead.  Then the queen\nlooked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said,\nwhite as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood, this time the\ndwarfs cannot wake you up again.\n\nAnd when she asked of the looking-glass at home,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd it answered at last,\n          oh, queen, in this land thou art fairest of all.\nThen her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can\nhave rest.\n\nThe dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found snow-white\nlying upon the ground, she breathed no longer and was dead.\nThey lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find\nanything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her\nwith water and wine, but it was all of no use, the poor child was\ndead, and remained dead.  They laid her upon a bier, and all\nseven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days\nlong.\n\nThen they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she\nwere living, and still had her pretty red cheeks.  They said,\nwe could not bury her in the dark ground, and they had a\ntransparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from\nall sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it\nin golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter.  Then they\nput the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always\nstayed by it and watched it.  And birds came too, and wept for\nsnow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.\n\nAnd now snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she\ndid not change, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was as\nwhite as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as\nebony.\n\nIt happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and\nwent to the dwarfs, house to spend the night.  He saw the coffin\non the mountain, and the beautiful snow-white within it, and read\nwhat was written upon it in golden letters.  Then he said to the\ndwarfs, let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want\nfor it.  But the dwarfs answered, we will not part with it for all\nthe gold in the world.  Then he said, let me have it as a gift, for\nI cannot live without seeing snow-white.  I will honor and prize\nher as my dearest possession.  As he spoke in this way the good\ndwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.\n\nAnd now the king's son had it carried away by his servants on\ntheir shoulders.  And it happened that they stumbled over a\ntree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple\nwhich snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat.  And\nbefore long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin,\nsat up, and was\nonce more alive.  Oh, heavens, where am I, she cried.  The king's\nson, full of joy, said, you are with me.  And told her what had\nhappened, and said, I love you more than everything in the\nworld, come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.\n\nAnd snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding\nwas held with great show and splendor.  But snow-white's\nwicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.  When she had\narrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the\nlooking-glass, and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThe glass answered,\n          oh, queen, of all here the fairest art thou,\n          but the young queen is fairer by far as I trow.\n\nThen the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched,\nso utterly wretched that she knew not what to do.  At first she\nwould not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and\nhad to go to see the young queen.  And when she went in she\nrecognized snow-white, and she stood still with rage and fear,\nand could not stir.  But iron slippers had already been put upon\nthe fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before\nher.  Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance\nuntil she dropped down dead.\n"
