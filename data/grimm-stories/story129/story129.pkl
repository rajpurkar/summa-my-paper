S"A servant girl is the only one to survive an attack by robbers. Not knowing what else to do, she sits down and gives God her situation. A white dove comes and gives her a key, which unlocks a tree where there is food. The dove brings another key to a tree where there is a bed, then another key to a tree where there are clothes. The girl lives like this for quite awhile until the dove asks her to retrieve a plain ring from an old woman's house. The girl catches the woman trying to sneak away with the ring and takes the ring back to the dove. The dove does not appear right away, so she leans against a tree which envelops her. She turns to see a handsome prince who has been transformed..."

S'A poor servant-girl was once traveling with the family with which she\nwas in service, through a great forest, and when they were in the\nmidst of it, robbers came out of the thicket, and murdered all they\nfound.  All perished together except the girl, who had jumped out of\nthe carriage in a fright, and hidden herself behind a tree.  When the\nrobbers had gone away with their booty, she came out and beheld the\ngreat disaster.  Then she began to weep bitterly, and said, "What can\na poor girl like me do now?  I do not know how to get out of the\nforest, no human being lives in it, so I must certainly starve."\n\nShe walked about and looked for a road, but could find none.  When it\nwas evening she seated herself under a tree, gave herself into God\'s\nkeeping, and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away, let\nhappen what might.  When she had sat there for a while, a white dove\ncame flying to her with a little golden key in its beak.  It put the\nlittle key in her hand, and said, "Do you see that great tree,\ntherein is a little lock, open it with the tiny key, and you will\nfind food enough, and suffer no more hunger."\n\nThen she went to the tree and opened it, and found milk in a little\ndish, and white bread to break into it, so that she could eat her\nfill.  When she was satisfied, she said, "It is now the time when the\nhens at home go to roost, I am so tired I could go to bed too." Then\nthe dove flew to her again, and brought another golden key in its\nbill, and said, "Open that tree there, and you will find a bed." So\nshe opened it, and found a beautiful white bed, and she prayed God to\nprotect her during the night, and lay down and slept.\n\nIn the morning the dove came for the third time, and again brought a\nlittle key, and said, "Open that tree there, and you will find\nclothes." And when she opened it, she found garments beset with gold\nand with jewels, more splendid than those of any king\'s daughter.  So\nshe lived there for some time, and the dove came every day and\nprovided her with all she needed, and it was a quiet good life.\n\nThen one day the dove came and said, "Will you do something for my\nsake?" "With all my heart," said the girl.  Then said the little\ndove, "I will guide you to a small house, enter it and inside it, an\nold woman will be sitting by the fire and will say, \'good-day.\' But\non your life give her no answer, let her do what she will, but pass\nby her on the right side. Further on, there is a door, which open,\nand you will enter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds\nare lying, amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining\nstones.  Leave them, however, where they are, and seek out a plain\none, which must likewise be amongst them, and bring it here to me as\nquickly as you can."\n\nThe girl went to the little house, and came to the door.  There sat\nan old woman who stared when she saw her, and said, "Good-day my\nchild." The girl gave her no answer, and opened the door.  "Whither\naway?" cried the old woman, and seized her by the gown, and wanted to\nhold her fast, saying, "That is my house, no one can go in there if I\nchoose not to allow it." But the girl was silent, got away from her,\nand went straight into the room.\n\nNow there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings, which\ngleamed and glittered before her eyes.  She turned them over and\nlooked for the plain one, but could not find it.  While she was\nseeking, she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and\nwanting to go off with a bird-cage which she had in her hand.  So she\nwent after her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised\nit up and looked into it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring\nin its bill.\n\nThen she took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and\nthought the little white dove would come and get the ring, but it did\nnot.  Then she leant against a tree, determined to wait for the dove.\nAs she thus stood, it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant,\nand was letting its branches down.  And suddenly the branches twined\naround her, and were two arms, and when she looked around, the tree\nwas a handsome man, who embraced and kissed her heartily, and said,\n"You have delivered me from the power of the old woman, who is a\nwicked witch.  She had changed me into a tree, and every day for two\nhours I was a white dove, and so long as she possessed the ring I\ncould not regain my human form." Then his servants and his horses,\nwho had likewise been changed into trees, were freed from the\nenchanter also, and stood beside him.  And he led them forth to his\nkingdom, for he was a king\'s son, and they married, and lived\nhappily.\n'
