S'A orphaned boy is placed in the care of a rich family. This family does not care for the boy, does not feed him enough, and punishes him often. Once the boy is put in charge of taking a basket of grapes and a letter to a judge. The boy is so hungry that he eats two grapes out of the basket. When the boy arrives with the grapes  the judge counts them and finds two are missing. The boy admits he ate the grapes. A second time the boy is sent to the judge with the basket of grapes. Again he eats two along the way. Again he is honest in admitting he ate the grapes. The judge writes the rich family that they should feed the boy better and should teach him right from wrong...'

S"There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother\nwere dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house\nof a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up.  The man and\nhis wife, however, had bad hearts, and were greedy and jealous of\ntheir riches, and vexed whenever anyone put a morsel of their\nbread in his mouth.  The poor young fellow might do what he\nliked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more.\nOne day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she escaped\nthrough a hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly,\nand carried her off through the air.  The boy called, thief,\nthief, rascal, with all the strength of his body.  But what good\ndid that do.  The hawk did not bring its prey back again.  The\nman heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he\nsaw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy\nsuch a beating that he could not stir for two days.  Then he\nhad to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his\ndifficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there.\nHe thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them\nall together with a string, because then the hawk would not\nbe able to steal any of them away from him.  But he was very\nmuch mistaken.  After two days, worn out with running about and\nhunger, he fell asleep.  The bird of prey came, and seized one\nof the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it\ncarried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and\ndevoured them.  The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw\nthe misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully\nthat he was forced to lie in bed for several days.\nWhen he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, you are\ntoo stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of you, you must\ngo as errand-boy.  Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he\nwas to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as\nwell.  On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy\nso violently that he ate two grapes.  He took the basket to the\njudge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the\ngrapes he said, two are missing.  The boy confessed quite honestly\nthat, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which\nwere missing.  The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked\nfor the same number of grapes again.  These also the boy had\nto take to him with a letter.  As he again was so extremely\nhungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two grapes.\nBut first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a\nstone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might\nnot see and betray him.  The judge, however, again made him give\nan explanation about the missing grapes.  Ah, said the boy,\nhow have you learnt that.  The letter could not know about it,\nfor I put it under a stone before I did it.  The judge could\nnot help laughing at the boy's simplicity, and sent the man a\nletter wherein he cautioned him to look after the poor boy better,\nand not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to\nteach him what was right and what was wrong.\nI will soon show you the difference, said the hard man, if\nyou will eat, you must work, and if you do anything wrong, you\nshall be quite sufficiently taught by blows.\nThe next day he set him a hard task.  He was to chop two bundles\nof hay for food for the horses, and then the man threatened, in\nfive hours, said he, I shall be back again, and if the hay\nis not chopped by that time, I will beat you until you can not\nmove a limb.  The\nfarmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the\nyearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit\nof bread.  The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to\nwork with all his might.  As he got warm over it he put his little\ncoat off and threw it on the hay.  In his terror lest he should\nnot get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his\nhaste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as\nthe hay.  He became aware of the misfortune too late.  There was\nno repairing it.  Ah, cried he, now all is over with me.  The\nwicked man did not threaten me for nothing.  If he comes back\nand sees what I have done, he will kill me.  Rather than that I\nwill take my own life.\nThe boy had once heard the farmer's wife say, I have a pot\nwith poison in it under my bed.  She, however, had only said\nthat to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it.\nThe boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all\nthat was in it.  I do not know, said he, folks say death is\nbitter, but it tastes very sweet to me.  It is no wonder\nthat the farmer's wife has so often longed for death.  He seated\nhimself in a little chair, and was prepared to die.  But instead\nof becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing\nfood.  It cannot have been poison, thought he, but the\nfarmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in\nthe closet in which he keeps his clothes.  That, no doubt, will\nbe the true poison, and bring death to me.  It was, however, no\npoison for flies, but hungarian wine.  The boy got out the bottle,\nand emptied it.  This death tastes sweet too, said he, but shortly\nafter when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy\nhim, he thought his end was drawing near.  I feel that I must die,\nsaid he, I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave.  He\nstaggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly\ndug grave.  He lost his senses more and more.  In the neighborhood\nwas an inn where a wedding was being held.  When he heard the\nmusic, he fancied he was already in paradise, until at length\nhe lost all consciousness.  The poor boy never awoke again.  The\nheat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of\nlife, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself.\nWhen the farmer heard the news of the boy's death he was terrified,\nand afraid of being brought to justice - indeed, his distress took\nsuch a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground.\nHis wife, who was standing by the hearth with a pan of hot fat,\nran to him to help him.  But the flames enveloped the pan, the\nwhole house caught fire, in a few hours it lay in ashes, and\nthe rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty\nand misery, tormented by the pangs of conscience.\n"
