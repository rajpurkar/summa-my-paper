S"There was once a poor peasant who had no land, but only a small\nhouse, and one daughter.  Then said the daughter, we ought to ask our\nlord the king for a bit of newly-cleared land.  When the king heard\nof their poverty, he presented them with a piece of land, which she\nand her father dug up, and intended to sow with a little corn and\ngrain of that kind.  When they had dug nearly the whole of the field,\nthey found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold.  Listen, said the\nfather to the girl, as our lord the king has been so gracious and\npresented us with the field, we ought to give him this mortar in\nreturn for it.  The daughter, however, would not consent to this, and\nsaid, father, if we have the mortar without having the pestle as\nwell, we shall have to get the pestle, so you had much better say\nnothing about it.  But he would not obey her, and took the mortar and\ncarried it to the king, said that he had found it in the cleared\nland, and asked if he would accept it as a present.  The king took\nthe mortar, and asked if he had found nothing besides that.  No,\nanswered the countryman.\n\nThen the king said that he must now bring him the pestle.  The\npeasant said they had not found that, but he might just as well have\nspoken to the wind, he was put in prison, and was to stay there until\nhe produced the pestle.  The servants had daily to carry him bread\nand water, which is what people get in prison, and they heard how the\nman cried out continually, ah, if I had but listened to my daughter.\nAlas, alas, if I had but listened to my daughter, and would neither\neat nor drink.  So he commanded the servants to bring the prisoner\nbefore him, and then the king asked the peasant why he was always\ncrying, ah, if I had but listened to my daughter, and what it was\nthat his daughter had said.  She told me that I ought not to take the\nmortar to you, for I should have to produce the pestle as well.  If\nyou have a daughter who is as wise as that, let her come here.\n\nShe was therefore obliged to appear before the king, who asked her if\nshe really was so wise, and said he would set her a riddle, and if\nshe could guess that, he would marry her.  She at once said yes, she\nwould guess it.  Then said the king, come to me not clothed, not\nnaked, not riding, not walking, not in the road, and not off the\nroad, and if you can do that I will marry you.\n\nSo she went away, put off everything she had on, and then she was not\nclothed, and took a great fishing net, and seated herself in it and\nwrapped it entirely round and round her, so that she was not naked,\nand she hired an ass, and tied the fisherman's net to its tail, so\nthat it was forced to drag her along, and that was neither riding nor\nwalking.  The ass had also to drag her in the ruts, so that she only\ntouched the ground with her big toe, and that was neither being in\nthe road nor off the road.  And when she arrived in that fashion, the\nking said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the\nconditions.\n\nThen he ordered her father to be released from the prison, took her\nto wife, and gave into her care all the royal possessions. Now when\nsome years had passed, the king was once reviewing his troops on\nparade, when it happened that some peasants who had been selling wood\nstopped with their waggons before the palace, some of them had oxen\nyoked to them, and some horses. There was one peasant who had three\nhorses, one of which was delivered of a young foal, and it ran away\nand lay down between two oxen which were in front of the waggon.\nWhen the peasants came together, they began to dispute, to beat each\nother and make a disturbance, and the peasant with the oxen wanted to\nkeep the foal, and said one of the oxen had given birth to it, and\nthe other said his horse had had it, and that it was his.  The\nquarrel came before the king, and he give the verdict that the foal\nshould stay where it had been found, and so the peasant with the\noxen, to whom it did not belong, got it.\n\nThen the other went away, and wept and lamented over his foal.  Now\nhe had heard how gracious his lady the queen was because she herself\nhad sprung from poor peasant folks, so he went to her and begged her\nto see if she could not help him to get his foal back again.  Said\nshe, yes, I will tell you what to do, if you will promise me not to\nbetray me.\n\nEarly to-morrow morning, when the king parades the guard, place\nyourself there in the middle of the road by which he must pass, take\na great fishing-net and pretend to be fishing, go on fishing, and\nempty out the net as if you had got it full, and then she told him\nalso what he was to say if he was questioned by the king.  The next\nday, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground.\nWhen the king passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask\nwhat the stupid man was about.  He answered, I am fishing.  The\nmessenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there.  The\npeasant said, it is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for\nan ox to have a foal.\n\nThe messenger went back and took the answer to the king, who ordered\nthe peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his\nown idea, and he wanted to know whose it was.  The peasant, said the\nking, must confess this at once.  The peasant, however, would not do\nso, and said always, God forbid he should, the idea was his own.  So\nthey laid him on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so\nlong that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the\nqueen.\n\nWhen the king reached home again, he said to his wife, why have you\nbehaved so falsely to me.  I will not have you any longer for a wife,\nyour time is up, go back to the place from whence you came - to your\npeasant's hut.  One favor, however, he granted her, she might take\nwith her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes, and\nthus was she dismissed.\n\nShe said, yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,\nand she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of\nhim.  Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to\ndrink farewell to him, the king took a long draught, but she took\nonly a little.  He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she\nperceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen\ncloth and wrapped the king in it, and the servant was forced to carry\nhim into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with\nhim to her own little house.\n\nShe laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one\nnight without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said,\ngood God, where am I.  He called his attendants, but none of them\nwere there.  At length his wife came to his bedside and said, my dear\nlord and king, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace\nthat which was dearest and most precious in my eyes - I have nothing\nmore precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.\n\nTears rose to the king's eyes and he said, dear wife, you shall be\nmine and I will be yours, and he took her back with him to the royal\npalace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are\nvery likely still living.\n"
