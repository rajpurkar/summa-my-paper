S"One summer's morning a little tailor was sitting on his table\nby the window, he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his\nmight.  Then came a peasant woman down the street crying, good\njams, cheap.  Good jams, cheap.  This rang pleasantly in the\ntailor's ears, he stretched his delicate head out of the\nwindow, and called, come up here, dear woman, here you will get\nrid of your goods.  The woman came up the three steps to the\ntailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\nfor him.  He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it,\nand at length said, the jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me\nout four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound\nthat is of no consequence.  The woman who had hoped to find a\ngood sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry\nand grumbling.  Now, this jam shall be blessed by God, cried the\nlittle tailor, and give me health and strength.  So he brought\nthe bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across\nthe loaf and spread the jam over it.  This won't taste bitter,\nsaid he, but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.\nHe laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger\nand bigger stitches.  In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they\nwere attracted and descended on it in hosts.  HI, who invited you,\nsaid the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away.  The\nflies, however, who understood no german, would not be turned\naway, but came back again in ever-increasing companies.  The\nlittle tailor at last lost all patience,\nand drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and\nsaying, wait, and I will give it to you, struck it mercilessly\non them.  When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him\nno fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out.  Are you a\nfellow of that sort, said he, and could not help admiring his own\nbravery.  The whole town shall know of this.  And the little tailor\nhastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on\nit in large letters, seven at one stroke.  What, the town, he\ncontinued, the whole world shall hear of it.  And his heart\nwagged with joy like a lamb's tail.  The tailor put on the girdle,\nand resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his\nworkshop was too small for his valor.  Before he went away, he\nsought about in the house to see if there was anything which he\ncould take with him, however, he found nothing but an old cheese,\nand that he put in his pocket.  In front of the door he observed a\nbird which had caught itself in the thicket.  It had to go into his\npocket with the cheese.  Now he took to the road boldly, and as he\nwas light and nimble, he felt no fatigue.  The road led him up a\nmountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there\nsat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him.  The little\ntailor went bravely up, spoke to him, and said, good day, comrade,\nso you are sitting there overlooking the wide-spread world.  I am\njust on my way thither, and want to try my luck.  Have you any\ninclination to go with me.  The giant looked contemptuously at the\ntailor, and said, you ragamuffin.  You miserable creature.\nOh, indeed, answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat,\nand showed the giant the girdle, there may you read what kind of\na man I am.  The giant read, seven at one stroke.  And thought\nthat they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to\nfeel a little respect for the tiny fellow.  Nevertheless, he\nwished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and\nsqueezed it together so that water dropped out of it.  Do that\nlikewise, said the giant, if you have strength.  Is that all, said\nthe tailor, that is child's play with us, and put his hand into his\npocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the\nliquid ran out\nof it.  Faith, said he, that was a little better, wasn't it.  The\ngiant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the\nlittle man.  Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it.  Now, little mite of a man,\ndo that likewise.  Well thrown, said the tailor, but after all the\nstone came down to earth again, I will throw you one which shall\nnever come back at all.  And he put his hand into his pocket,\ntook out the bird, and threw it into the air.  The bird,\ndelighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come\nback.  How does that shot please you, comrade, asked the tailor.\nYou can certainly throw, said the giant, but now we will see if\nyou are able to carry anything properly.  He took the little\ntailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground,\nand said, if you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out\nof the forest.  Readily, answered the little man, take the trunk\non your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs,\nafter all, they are the heaviest.  The giant took the trunk on\nhis shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the\ngiant who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree,\nand the little tailor into the bargain, he behind, was quite\nmerry and happy, and whistled the song, three tailors rode forth\nfrom the gate, as if carrying the tree were child's play.  The\ngiant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way,\ncould go no further, and cried, hark you, I shall have to let the\ntree fall.  The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with\nboth arms as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant,\nyou are such a great fellow, and yet can not even carry the tree.\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant\nlaid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was\nhanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor's hand, and bade\nhim eat.  But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the\ntree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the\ntailor was tossed into the air with it.  When he had fallen down\nagain without injury, the giant said, what is this.  Have you\nnot strength enough to hold the weak twig.  There is no lack of\nstrength, answered the little tailor.  Do you think that could be\nanything to a man who has\nstruck down seven at one blow.  I leapt over the tree because the\nhuntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.  Jump as I did,\nif you can do it.  The giant made the attempt, but could not get\nover the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in\nthis also the tailor kept the upper hand.\nThe giant said, if you are such a valiant fellow, come with me\ninto our cavern and spend the night with us.  The little tailor\nwas willing, and followed him.  When they went into the cave,\nother giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of them\nhad a roasted sheep in his hand and was eating it.  The little\ntailor looked round and thought, it is much more spacious here\nthan in my workshop.  The giant showed him a bed, and said he was\nto lie down in it and sleep.  The bed, however, was too big for\nthe little tailor, he did not lie down in it, but crept into a\ncorner.  When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the\nlittle tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great\niron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had\nfinished off the grasshopper for good.  With the earliest dawn\nthe giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten the little\ntailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily\nand boldly.  The giants were terrified, they were afraid that he\nwould strike them all dead, and ran away in a great hurry.\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own\npointed nose.  After he had walked for a long time, he came to the\ncourtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down\non the grass and fell asleep.  Whilst he lay there, the people\ncame and inspected him on all sides, and read on his girdle,\nseven at one stroke.  Ah, said they, what does the great warrior\nhere in the midst of peace.  He must be a mighty lord.  They went\nand announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that\nif war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man\nwho ought on no account to be allowed to depart.  The counsel\npleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little\ntailor to offer him military service when he awoke.  The\nambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he\nstretched his limbs and\nopened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal.  For this\nreason have I come here, the tailor replied, I am ready to enter\nthe king's service.  He was therefore honorably received and a\nspecial dwelling was assigned him.\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and\nwished him a thousand miles away.  What is to be the end of this,\nthey said among themselves.  If we quarrel with him, and he strikes\nabout him, seven of us will fall at every blow, not one of\nus can stand against him.  They came therefore to a decision,\nbetook themselves in a body to the king, and begged for their\ndismissal.  We are not prepared, said they, to stay with a man\nwho kills seven at one stroke.  The king was sorry that for the\nsake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that\nhe had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have\nbeen rid of him again.  But he did not venture to give him his\ndismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his\npeople dead, and place himself on the royal throne.  He thought\nabout it for a long time, and at last found good counsel.  He\nsent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as\nhe was such a great warrior, he had one request to make of him.\nIn a forest of his country lived two giants who caused great\nmischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning,\nand no one could approach them without putting himself in danger\nof death.  If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants,\nhe would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his\nkingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with\nhim to assist him.  That would indeed be a fine thing for a man\nlike me, thought the little tailor.  One is not offered a\nbeautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one's life.\nOh, yes, he replied, I will soon subdue the giants, and do not\nrequire the help of the hundred horsemen to do it, he who can\nhit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed\nhim.  When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to\nhis followers, just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish\noff the giants.  Then he bounded into the forest and looked about\nright and left.  After a while he perceived both giants.  They lay\nsleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up\nand down.  The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful\nof stones, and with these climbed up the tree.  When he was\nhalf-way up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above\nthe sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the\nbreast of one of the giants.  For a long time the giant felt\nnothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said, why\nare you knocking me.  You must be dreaming, said the other, I am\nnot knocking you.  They laid themselves down to sleep again, and\nthen the tailor threw a stone down on the second.  What is the\nmeaning of this, cried the other.  Why are you pelting me.  I am\nnot pelting you, answered the first, growling.  They disputed\nabout it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter\nrest, and their eyes closed once more.  The little tailor began\nhis game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with\nall his might on the breast of the first giant.  That is too\nbad, cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\ncompanion against the tree until it shook.  The other paid him\nback in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they\ntore up trees and belabored each other so long, that at last they\nboth fell down dead on the ground at the same time.  Then the\nlittle tailor leapt down.  It is a lucky thing, said he, that\nthey did not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should\nhave had to spring on to another like a squirrel, but we tailors\nare nimble.  He drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple\nof thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and\nsaid, the work is done, I have finished both of them off, but it\nwas hard work.  They tore up trees in their sore need, and\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose\nwhen a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.\nBut you are not wounded, asked the horsemen.  You need not\nconcern yourself about that, answered the tailor, they have not\nbent one hair of mine.  The horsemen would not believe him, and\nrode into the forest, there they found the giants swimming in their\nblood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees.\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward.  He,\nhowever, repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how\nhe could get rid of the hero.  Before you receive my daughter,\nand the half of my kingdom, said he to him, you must perform one\nmore heroic deed.  In the forest roams a unicorn which does great\nharm, and you must catch it first.  I fear one unicorn still\nless than two giants.  Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair.\nHe took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest,\nand again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside.  He\nhad not long to seek.  The unicorn soon came towards him, and\nrushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\nhorn without more ado.  Softly, softly, it can't be done as\nquickly as that, said he, and stood still and waited until the\nanimal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree.\nThe unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and\nstruck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not strength\nenough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught.  Now, I have\ngot the bird, said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree\nand put the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed\nthe horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast\naway and took it to the king.\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made\na third demand.  Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a\nwild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen\nshould give him their help.  Willingly, said the tailor, that is\nchild's play.  He did not take the huntsmen with him into the\nforest, and they were well pleased that he did not, for the wild\nboar had several times received them in such a manner that they\nhad no inclination to lie in wait for him.  When the boar\nperceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the\nhero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near, and up to the\nwindow at once, and in one bound out again.  The boar ran in\nafter him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door\nbehind it, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy\nand awkward to leap out of the window, was caught.  The little\ntailor called the huntsmen thither\nthat they might see the prisoner with their own eyes.  The hero,\nhowever went to the king, who was now, whether he liked it or\nnot, obliged to keep his promise, and gave him his daughter and\nthe half of his kingdom.  Had he known that it was no warlike\nhero, but a little tailor who was standing before him it would\nhave gone to his heart still more than it did.  The wedding was\nheld with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a\ntailor a king was made.\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his\ndreams at night, boy, make me the doublet, and patch the\npantaloons, or else I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.\nThen she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been\nborn, and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father, and\nbegged him to help her to get rid of her husband, who was\nnothing else but a tailor.  The king comforted her and said,\nleave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants shall\nstand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\nhim, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the\nwide world.  The woman was satisfied with this, but the king's\narmor-bearer, who had heard all, was friendly with the young\nlord, and informed him of the whole plot.  I'll put a screw into\nthat business, said the little tailor.  At night he went to bed\nwith his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he\nhad fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down\nagain.  The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep,\nbegan to cry out in a clear voice, boy, make me the doublet and\npatch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over\nyour ears.  I smote seven at one blow.  I killed two giants, I\nbrought away one unicorn and caught a wild boar, and am I to\nfear those who are standing outside the room.  When these men\nheard the tailor speaking thus, they were overcome by a great\ndread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, and none\nof them would venture anything further against him.  So the little\ntailor was and remained a king to the end of his life.\n"
