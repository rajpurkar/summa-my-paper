S"There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a\nlittle cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always\nlived from hand to mouth.  But it came to pass one day when the man\nwas sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out\na fish entirely of gold.  As he was looking at the fish, full of\nastonishment, it began to speak and said, listen, fisherman, if you\nwill throw me back again into the water, I will change your little\nhut into a splendid castle.\n\nThen the fisherman answered, of what use is a castle to me, if I have\nnothing to eat.  The gold fish continued, that shall be taken care\nof, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open\nit, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them\nas you can desire.  If that be true, said the man, then I can well do\nyou a favor.  Yes, said the fish, there is, however, the condition\nthat you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be,\nwhence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all\nwill be over.  Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into\nthe water, and went home.\n\nBut where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He\nopened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful\nclothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and\nsaid, husband, how has all this come to pass.  It suits me very well.\nYes, said the man, it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just\ngive me something to eat.  Said the wife, but I have got nothing and\ndon't know where to find anything in this new house.  There is no\nneed of your knowing, said the man, for I see yonder a great\ncupboard, just unlock it. When she opened it, there stood cakes,\nmeat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect.\n\nThen the woman cried joyfully, what more can you want, my dear. And\nthey sat down, and ate and drank together.  When they had had enough,\nthe woman said, but husband, whence come all these riches. Alas,\nanswered he, do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you\nanything.  If I disclose it to anyone, then all our good fortune will\ndisappear.  Very good, said she, if I am not to know anything, then I\ndo not want to know anything.  However, she was not in earnest.  She\nnever rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his\nimpatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish\nwhich he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty.\nAnd as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the\ncupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old\nfisherman's hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade\nand fish.\n\nBut fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden\nfish.  Listen, said the fish, if you will throw me back into the\nwater again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard\nfull of roast and boiled meats.  Only be firm, for your life's sake\ndon't reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again.  I\nwill take good care, answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back\ninto the water.  Now at home everything was once more in its former\nmagnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but\ncuriosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began\nto ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to\nsecure it.  The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she\nmade him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret.\n\nIn an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in\ntheir old hut.  Now you have got what you want, said he, and we can\ngnaw at a bare bone again.  Ah, said the woman, I had rather not have\nriches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no\npeace.\n\nThe man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out\nthe gold fish for a third time.  Listen, said the fish, I see very\nwell that I am fated to fall into your hands, take me home and cut me\ninto six pieces.  Give your wife two of them to eat, two to your\nhorse and bury two of them in the ground, then they will bring you a\nblessing.  The fisherman took the fish home with him, and did as it\nhad bidden him.  It came to pass, however, that from the two pieces\nthat were buried in the ground two golden lilies sprang up, that the\nhorse had two golden foals, and the fisherman's wife bore two\nchildren who were made entirely of gold.  The children grew up,\nbecame tall and handsome, and the lilies and horses grew likewise.\nThen they said, father, we want to mount our golden steeds and travel\nout in the world.  But he answered sorrowfully, how shall I bear it\nif you go away, and I know not how it fares with you.  Then they\nsaid, the two golden lilies remain here.  By them you can see how it\nis with us.  If they are fresh, then we are in health.  If they are\nwithered, we are ill.  If they perish, then we are dead.\n\nSo they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people, and\nwhen they perceived the gold-children they began to laugh, and jeer.\nWhen one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go\nout into the world, but turned back and went home again to his\nfather.  But the other rode forward and reached a great forest. As he\nwas about to enter it, the people said, it is not safe for you to\nride through, the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly.\nYou will fare ill, and when they see that you are all of gold, and\nyour horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.\n\nBut he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, I must and\nwill ride through it.  Then he took bear-skins and covered himself\nand his horse with them, so that the gold was no more to be seen, and\nrode fearlessly into the forest.  When he had ridden onward a little\nhe heard a rustling in the bushes, and heard voices speaking\ntogether.  From one side came cries of, there is one, but from the\nother, let him go, 'tis a bearskin, as poor and bare as a\nchurch-mouse, what should we gain from him.  So the gold-child rode\njoyfully through the forest, and no evil befell him.\n\nOne day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so\nbeautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she\nexisted in the world.  And as such a mighty love took possession of\nhim, he went up to her and said, I love you with my whole heart, will\nyou be my wife.  He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed\nand said, yes, I will be your wife, and be true to you my whole life\nlong.\n\nThen they were married, and just as they were in the greatest\nhappiness, home came the father of the bride, and when he saw that\nhis daughter's wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and\nsaid, where is the bridegroom.  They showed him the gold-child, who,\nhowever, still wore his bear-skins.  Then the father said wrathfully,\na bearskin shall never have my daughter.  And was about to kill him.\nThen the bride begged as hard as she could, and said, he is my\nhusband, and I love him with all my heart.  Until at last he allowed\nhimself to be appeased.  Nevertheless the idea never left his\nthoughts, so that next morning he rose early, wishing to see whether\nhis daughter's husband was a common ragged beggar.  But when he\npeeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man in the bed, and the\ncast-off bear-skins lying on the ground.  Then he went back and\nthought, what a good thing it was that I restrained my anger.  I\nwould have committed a great crime.\n\nBut the gold-child dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag,\nand when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, I must go out\nhunting.  She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, you\nmight easily meet with a great misfortune.  But he answered, I must\nand will go.\n\nThereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest, and it was not\nlong before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his\ndream.  He aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away.\nHe gave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without\nfeeling tired, but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight,\nand when the gold-child looked round him, he was standing before a\nlittle house, wherein sat a witch.\n\nHe knocked and a little old woman came out and asked, what are you\ndoing so late in the midst of the great forest.  Have you not seen a\nstag. Yes, answered she, I know the stag well.  And thereupon a\nlittle dog which had come out of the house with her, barked at the\nman violently.  Will you be silent, you odious toad, said he, or I\nwill shoot you dead.  Then the witch cried out in a passion, what\nwill you slay my little dog.  And immediately transformed him, so\nthat he lay like a stone, and his bride awaited him in vain and\nthought, that which I so greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my\nheart, has come upon him.\n\nBut at home the other brother was standing by the gold-lilies, when\none of them suddenly drooped. Good heavens, said he, my brother has\nmet with some great misfortune I must away to see if I can possibly\nrescue him.  Then the father said, stay here, if I lose you also,\nwhat shall I do. But he answered, I must and will go forth.\n\nThen he mounted his golden horse, and rode forth and entered the\ngreat forest, where his brother lay turned to stone.  The old witch\ncame out of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also, but\nhe did not go near her, and said, I will shoot you, if you will not\nbring my brother to life again.  She touched the stone, though very\nunwillingly, with her forefinger, and he was immediately restored to\nhis human shape.  And the two gold-children rejoiced when they saw\neach other again, kissed and caressed each other, and rode away\ntogether out of the forest the one home to his bride, and the other\nto his father.\n\nThe father then said, I knew well that you had rescued your brother,\nfor the golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again. Then\nthey lived happily, and they prospered until their death.\n"
