S'A cat and mouse set up housekeeping together. To be prepared for hard times they purchase a pot of fat which they store in the safety of a church. The cat devises a scheme to leave the house and have some of the fat for herself. She leaves the house three times under pretense of going to a christening. Actually, she makes three visits to the fat pot and eats all of the fat. When the cat and mouse go to the church to eat their fat they find the fat pot empty. When the mouse confronts the cat, the cat eats the mouse. '

S"A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had\nsaid so much to her about the great love and friendship she\nfelt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should\nlive and keep house together.  But we must make a provision\nfor winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger, said the cat,\nand you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be\ncaught in a trap some day.  The good advice was followed, and a\npot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it.\nAt length, after much consideration, the cat said, I know no place\nwhere it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\ndares take anything away from there.  We will set it beneath the\naltar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.  So\nthe pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat\nhad a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse, I want to\ntell you something, little mouse, my cousin has brought a little\nson into the world, and has asked me to be godmother, he is white\nwith brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the\nchristening.  Let me go out to-day, and you look after the house\nby yourself.  Yes, yes, answered the mouse, by all means go, and if\nyou get anything very good to eat, think of\nme, I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\nAll this, however, was untrue, the cat had no cousin, and had not\nbeen asked to be godmother.  She went straight to the church, stole\nto the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the\nfat off.  Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked\nout for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and\nlicked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not\nuntil it was evening did she return home.  Well, here you are\nagain, said the mouse, no doubt you have had a merry day.  All went\noff well, answered the cat.  What name did they give the child.\nTop off, said the cat quite coolly.  Top off, cried the mouse,\nthat is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your\nfamily.  What does that matter, said the cat, it is no worse than\ncrumb-stealer, as your God-children are called.\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning.  She\nsaid to the mouse, you must do me a favor, and once more manage\nthe house for a day alone.  I am again asked to be godmother, and,\nas the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\nThe good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls\nto the church, and devoured half the pot of fat.  Nothing ever\nseems so good as what one keeps to oneself, said she, and was quite\nsatisfied with her day's work.  When she went home the mouse\ninquired, and what was this child christened.  Half-done, answered\nthe cat.  Half-done.  What are you saying.  I never heard the name\nin my life, I'll wager anything it is not in the calendar.\nThe cat's mouth soon began to water for some more licking.  All\ngood things go in threes, said she, I am asked to stand godmother\nagain.  The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with\nthat exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body,\nthis only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won't\nyou.  Top-off.  Half-done, answered the mouse, they are such odd\nnames, they make me very thoughtful.  You sit at home, said the\ncat, in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled\nwith fancies, that's because you do not go out in the daytime.\nDuring the cat's absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it\nin order\nbut the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat.  When\neverything is eaten up one has some peace, said she to herself,\nand well filled and fat she did not return home till night.  The\nmouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child.\nIt will not please you more than the others, said the cat.  He\nis called all-gone.  All-gone, cried the mouse, that is the most\nsuspicious name of all.  I have never seen it in print.  All-gone,\nwhat can that mean, and she shook her head, curled herself up,\nand lay down to sleep.\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be\nfound outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said,\ncome cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up\nfor ourselves - we shall enjoy that.  Yes, answered the cat, you\nwill enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty\ntongue of yours out of the window.  They set out on their way,\nbut when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its\nplace, but it was empty.  Alas, said the mouse, now I see what has\nhappened, now it comes to light.  You are a true friend.  You\nhave devoured all when you were standing godmother.  First top off\nthen half done, then -.  Will you hold your tongue, cried the\ncat, one word more and I will eat you too.  All gone was already\non the poor mouse's lips, scarcely had she spoken it before the\ncat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down.  Verily,\nthat is the way of the world.\n"
