A cat and mouse set up housekeeping together. To be prepared for hard times they purchase a pot of fat which they store in the safety of a church. The cat devises a scheme to leave the house and have some of the fat for herself. She leaves the house three times under pretense of going to a christening. Actually, she makes three visits to the fat pot and eats all of the fat. When the cat and mouse go to the church to eat their fat they find the fat pot empty. When the mouse confronts the cat, the cat eats the mouse.
