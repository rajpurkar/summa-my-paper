S'One day while a hare and hedgehog are out walking, the hare makes a snide comment about the hedgehog\'s legs. They decide to run a footrace to see which animal can outrun the other. The hedgehog goes home and employs his wife, who looks just like him, to help him. The hedgehog sets up the race track in the two ruts of a road. The wife is to stand at the end of one rut. When the hare calls out he has run the race, she is to cry out that she is already at the finish line. In this manner, the hedgehog "wins" the first race. Not wanting to be outdone, the hare decides to turn around and run the race again. This time it is the husband hedgehog who calls out that he is the winner. The...'

S"This story, my dear young folks, seems to be false, but it really\nis true, for my grandfather, from whom I have it, used always,\nwhen relating it, to say, it must be true, my son, or else no\none could tell it to you.  The story is as follows.  One sunday\nmorning about harvest time, just as the buckwheat was in bloom,\nthe sun was shining brightly in heaven, the east wind was\nblowing warmly over the stubble-fields, the larks were singing\nin the air, the bees buzzing among the buckwheat, the people\nin their sunday clothes were all going to church, and all creatures\nwere happy, and the hedgehog was happy too.\nThe hedgehog, however, was standing by his door with his arms\nakimbo, enjoying the morning breezes, and slowly trilling a\nlittle song to himself, which was neither better nor worse than\nthe songs which hedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed\nsunday morning.  Whilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself,\nit suddenly occurred to him that, while his wife was washing and\ndrying the children, he might very well take a walk into the field,\nand see how his turnips were getting on.  The turnips, in fact,\nwere close beside his house, and he and his family were accustomed\nto eat them, for which reason he looked upon them as his own.\nNo sooner said than\ndone.  The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him, and took the\npath to the field.  He had not gone very far from home, and\nwas just turning round the sloe-bush which stands there outside the\nfield, to go up into the turnip-field, when he observed the hare\nwho had gone out on business of the same kind, namely, to visit his\ncabbages.  When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare, he bade him\na friendly good morning.  But the hare, who was in his own way a\ndistinguished gentleman, and frightfully haughty, did not return\nthe hedgehog's greeting, but said to him, assuming at the same\ntime a very contemptuous manner, how do you happen to be\nrunning about here in the field so early in the morning.  I am\ntaking a walk, said the hedgehog.  A walk, said the hare, with\na smile.  It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better\npurpose.  This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry, for he\ncan bear anything but a reference too his legs, just because they\nare crooked by nature.  So now the hedgehog said to the hare, you\nseem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with\nmine.  That is just what I do think, said the hare.  That can\nbe put to the test, said the hedgehog.  I wager that if we run\na race, I will outstrip you.  That is ridiculous.  You with your\nshort legs, said the hare, but for my part I am willing, if you\nhave such a monstrous fancy for it.  What shall we wager.  A\ngolden louis-d'or and a bottle of brandy, said the hedgehog.  Done,\nsaid the hare.  Shake hands on it, and then we may as well begin\nat once.  Nay, said the hedgehog, there is no such great hurry.\nI am still fasting, I will go home first, and have a little\nbreakfast.  In half-an-hour I will be back again at this\nplace.\nHereupon the hedgehog departed, for the hare was quite satisfied\nwith this.  On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, the hare\nrelies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better\nof him.  He may be a great man, but he is a very silly fellow,\nand he shall pay for what he has said.  So when the hedgehog\nreached home, he said to his wife, wife, dress yourself quickly,\nyou must go out to the field with me.  What is going on, then,\nsaid his wife.  I have made a wager with the hare, for a gold\nlouis-d'or and a bottle of\nbrandy.  I am to run a race with him, and you must be present.\nGood heavens, husband, the wife now cried, are you not right in\nyour mind, have you completely lost your wits.  What can make\nyou want to run a race with the hare.  Hold your tongue, woman,\nsaid the hedgehog, that is my affair.  Don't begin to discuss\nthings which are matters for men.  Be off, dress yourself, and\ncome with me.  What could the hedgehog's wife do.  She was forced\nto obey him, whether she liked it or not.\nSo when they had set out on their way together, the hedgehog\nsaid to his wife, now pay attention to what I am going to say.\nLook you, I will make the long field our race-course.  The hare\nshall run in one furrow, and when the hare arrives at the end\nof the furrow on the other side of you, you must cry out to him,\nI am here already.\nThen they reached the field, and the hedgehog showed his wife\nher place, and then walked up the field.  When he reached the\ntop, the hare was already there.  Shall we start, said the\nhare.  Certainly, said the hedgehog.  Then both at once.  So\nsaying, each placed himself in his own furrow.  The hare counted,\nonce, twice, thrice, and away, and went off like a whirlwind\ndown the field.  The hedgehog, however, only ran about three\npaces, and then he crouched down in the furrow, and stayed\nquietly where he was.\nWhen the hare therefore arrived at full speed at the lower end\nof the field, the hedgehog's wife met him with the cry, I am\nhere already.  The hare was shocked and wondered not a little,\nhe thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was\ncalling to him, for the hedgehog's wife looked just like her\nhusband.  The hare, however, thought to himself, that has not\nbeen done fairly, and cried, it must be run again, let us have it\nagain.  And once more he went off like the wind in a storm, so\nthat he seemed to fly.  But the hedgehog's wife stayed quietly\nin her place.  So when the hare reached the top of the field, the\nhedgehog himself cried out to him, I am here already.  The\nhare, however, quite beside himself\nwith anger, cried, it must be run again, we must have it again.\nAll right, answered the hedgehog, for my part we'll run as often\nas you choose.  So the hare ran seventy-three times more, and\nthe hedgehog always held out against him, and every time the\nhare reached either the top or the bottom, either the hedgehog\nor his wife said, I am here already.\nAt the seventy-fourth time, however, the hare could no longer\nreach the end.  In the middle of the field he fell to the\nground, blood streamed out of his mouth, and he lay dead on\nthe spot.  But the hedgehog took the louis-d'or which he had\nwon and the bottle of brandy, called his wife out of the furrow,\nand both went home together in great delight, and if they are not\ndead, they are living there still.\nThis is how it happened that the hedgehog made the hare run races\nwith him on the heath of buxtehude - buxtehude is a village near\nhamburg - till he died, and since that time no hare has ever\nhad any fancy for running races with a buxtehude hedgehog.\nThe moral of this story is, firstly, that no one, however great\nhe may be, should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him,\neven if he be only a hedgehog.  And, secondly, it teaches, that\nwhen a man marries, he should take a wife in his own position,\nwho looks just as he himself looks.  So whosoever is a\nhedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also,\nand so forth.\n"
