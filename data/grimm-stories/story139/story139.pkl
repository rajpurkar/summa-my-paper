S"There was once upon a time a fisherman who lived with his wife\nin a pig-stye close by the sea, and every day he went out fishing.\nAnd he fished, and he fished.  And once he was sitting with his\nrod, looking at the clear water, and he sat and he sat.  Then\nhis line suddenly went down, far down below, and when\nhe drew it up again, he brought out a large flounder.  Then the\nflounder said to him, hark, you fisherman, I pray you, let me\nlive, I am no flounder really, but an enchanted prince.  What\ngood will it do you to kill me.  I should not be good to eat, put\nme in the water again, and let me go.  Come, said the fisherman,\nthere is no need for so many words about it - a fish that can\ntalk I should certainly let go, anyhow.  And with that he put\nhim back again into the clear water, and the flounder went to the\nbottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him.  Then the\nfisherman got up and went home to his wife in the pig-stye.\nHusband, said the woman, have you caught nothing to-day.  No, said\nthe man, I did catch a flounder, who said he was an enchanted\nprince, so I let him go again.  Did you not wish for anything\nfirst, said the woman.  No, said the man, what should I wish\nfor.  Ah, said the woman, it is surely hard to have to live\nalways in this pig-stye which stinks and is so disgusting.  You\nmight have wished for a little hut for us.  Go back and call\nhim.  Tell him we want to have a little hut, he will certainly\ngive us that.  Ah, said the man, why should I go there again.\nWhy, said the woman, you did catch him, and you let him go again.\nHe is sure to do it.  Go at once.  The man still did not quite\nlike to go, but did not like to oppose his wife either, and\nwent to the sea.\nWhen he got there the sea was all green and yellow, and no\nlonger so smooth, so he stood still and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.\n          For my wife, good ilsabil,\n          wills not as I'd have her will.\nThen the flounder came swimming to him and said, well what does\nshe want, then.  Ah, said the man, I did catch you, and\nmy wife says I really ought to have wished for something.\nShe does not like to live in a pig-stye any longer.  She would\nlike to have a hut.  Go, then, said the flounder, she has it\nalready.\nWhen the man went home, his wife was no longer in the stye,\nbut instead of it there stood a hut, and she was sitting on a\nbench before the door.  Then she took him by the hand and said\nto him, just come inside.  Look, now isn't this a great deal\nbetter.  So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a\npretty little parlor and bedroom, and a kitchen and pantry,\nwith the best of furniture, and fitted up with the most\nbeautiful things made of tin and brass, whatsoever was wanted.\nAnd behind the hut there was a  small yard, with hens and ducks,\nand a little garden with flowers and fruit.  Look, said the\nwife, is not that nice.  Yes, said the husband, and so it shall\nremain - now we will live quite contented.  We will think about\nthat said the wife.  With that they ate something and went to\nbed.\nEverything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the\nwoman said, hark you, husband, this hut is far too small for us,\nand the garden and yard are little.  The flounder might just as\nwell have given us a larger house.  I should like to live in a\ngreat stone castle.  Go to the flounder, and tell him to give\nus a castle.  Ah, wife, said the man, the hut is quite good\nenough.  Why whould we live in a castle.  What. Said the\nwoman.  Just go there, the flounder can always do that.  No,\nwife, said the man, the flounder has just given us the hut,\nI do not like to go back so soon, it might make him angry.\nGo, said the woman, he can do it quite easily, and will be glad\nto do it.  Just you go to him.\nThe man's heart grew heavy, and he would not go.  He said to\nhimself, it is not right, and yet he went.  And when he came\nto the sea the water was quite purple and dark-blue, and grey\nand thick, and no longer so green and yellow, but it was still\nquiet.  And he stood there and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.\n          For my wife, good ilsabil,\n          wills not as I'd have her will.\nWell, what does she want, now, said the flounder.  Alas, said\nthe man, half scared, she wants to live in a great stone castle.\nGo to it, then, she is standing before the door, said the\nflounder.\nThen the man went away, intending to go home, but when he\ngot there, he found a great stone palace, and his wife was\njust standing on the steps going in, and she took him by the\nhand and said, come in.  So he went in with her, and in the\ncastle was a great hall paved with marble, and many servants,\nwho flung wide the doors.  And the walls were all bright with\nbeautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs and tables\nof pure gold, and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling,\nand all the rooms and bedrooms had carpets, and food and wine\nof the very best were standing on all the tables, so that they\nnearly broke down beneath it.  Behind the house, too, there\nwas a great court-yard, with stables for horses and cows, and\nthe very best of carriages.  There was a magnificent large\ngarden, too, with the most beautiful flowers and fruit-trees,\nand a park quite half a mile long, in which were stags, deer,\nand hares, and everything that could be desired.  Come, said\nthe woman, isn't that beautiful.  Yes, indeed, said the man,\nnow let it be, and we will live in this beautiful castle\nand be content.  We will consider about that, said the woman,\nand sleep upon it.  Thereupon they went to bed.\nNext morning the wife awoke first, and it was just daybreak,\nand from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before\nher.  Her husband was still stretching himself, so she poked\nhim in the side with her elbow, and said, get up, husband,\nand just peep out of the window.  Look you, couldn't we be the\nking over all that land.  Go to the flounder, we will be the\nking.  Ah, wife, said the man, why should we be king.  I\ndo not want to be king.  Well, said the wife, if you won't be\nking, I will.  Go to the flounder, for I will be king.  Ah,\nwife, said the man, why do you want to be king.  I do not like\nto say that to him.  Why not, said the woman.  Go to him this\ninstant.  I must be king.  So the man went, and was quite\nunhappy because his wife wished to be king.  It is not right,\nit is not right, thought he.  He did not wish to go, but yet\nhe went.\nAnd when he came to the sea, it was quite dark-grey, and the\nwater heaved up from below, and smelt putrid.  Then he went\nand stood by it, and said,\n\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.\n          For my wife, good ilsabil,\n          wills not as I'd have her will.\nWell, what does she want, now. Said the flounder.  Alas, said\nthe man, she wants to be king.  Go to her.  She is king\nalready.\nSo the man went, and when he came to the palace, the castle\nhad become much larger, and had a great tower and magnificent\nornaments, and the sentinel was standing before the door, and\nthere were numbers of soldiers with kettle-drums and trumpets.\nAnd\nwhen he went inside the house, everything was of real marble\nand gold, with velvet covers and great golden tassels.  Then\nthe doors of the hall were opened, and there was the court in\nall its splendor, and his wife was sitting on a high throne\nof gold and diamonds, with a great crown of gold on her head,\nand a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand, and on\nboth sides of her stood her maids-in-waiting in a row, each\nof them always one head shorter than the last.\nThen he went and stood before her, and said, ah, wife, and\nnow you are king.  Yes, said the woman, now I am king.  So\nhe stood and looked at her, and when he had looked at her thus\nfor some time, he said, and now that you are king, let all else\nbe, now we will wish for nothing more.  No, husband, said the\nwoman, quite anxiously, I find time passes very heavily, I can\nbear it no longer.  Go to the flounder - I am king, but I must\nbe emperor, too.  Oh, wife, why do you wish to be emperor.\nHusband, said she, go to the flounder.  I will be emperor.\nAlas, wife, said the man, he cannot make you emperor.  I may not\nsay that to the fish.  There is only one emperor in the land.  An\nemperor the flounder cannot make you.  I assure you he cannot.\nWhat. Said the woman, I am the king, and you are nothing but\nmy husband.  Will you go this moment.  Go at once.  If he can\nmake a king he can make an emperor.  I will be emperor.  Go\ninstantly.  So he was forced to go.  As the man went, however, he\nwas troubled in mind, and thought to himself, it will not end\nwell.  It will not end well.  Emperor is too shameless.  The\nflounder will at last be tired out.\nWith that he reached the sea, and the sea was quite black and\nthick, and began to boil up from below, so that it threw up\nbubbles, and such a sharp wind blew over it that it curdled, and\nthe man was afraid.  Then he went and stood by it, and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.\n          For my wife, good ilsabil,\n          wills not as I'd have her will.\nWell, what does she want, now, said the flounder.  Alas, flounder,\nsaid he, my wife wants to be emperor.  Go to her, said the\nflounder.  She is emperor already.\nSo the man went, and when he got there the whole palace was made\nof polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments,\nand soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets,\nand beating cymbals and drums.  And in the house, barons, and\ncounts, and dukes were going about as servants.  Then they opened\nthe doors to him, which were of pure gold.  And when he\nentered, there sat his wife on a throne, which was made of one\npiece of gold, and was quite two miles high.  And she wore a great\ngolden crown that was three yards high, and set with diamonds and\ncarbuncles, and in one hand she had the sceptre, and in the\nother the imperial orb.  And on both sides of her stood the\nyeomen of the guard in two rows, each being smaller than the one\nbefore him, from the biggest giant, who was two miles high, to the\nvery smallest dwarf, just as big as my little finger.  And\nbefore it stood a number of princes and dukes.\nThen the man went and stood among them, and said, wife, are you\nemperor now.  Yes, said she, now I am emperor.  Then he stood\nand looked at her well, and when he had looked at her thus for\nsome time, he said, ah, wife, be content, now that you are\nemperor.  Husband, said she, why are you standing there.  Now, I\nam emperor, but I will be pope too.  Go to the flounder.  Oh,\nwife, said the man, what will you not wish for.  You cannot be\npope.  There is but one in christendom.  He cannot make you pope.\nHusband, said she, I will be pope.  Go immediately, I must be\npope this very day.  No, wife, said the man, I do not like to\nsay that to him.  That would not do, it is too much.  The flounder\ncan't make you pope.  Husband, said she, what nonsense.  If he\ncan make an emperor he can make a pope.  Go to him directly.\nI am emperor, and you are nothing but my husband.  Will you go\nat once.\nThen he was afraid and went, but he was quite faint, and\nshivered and shook, and his knees and legs trembled.  And a high\nwind blew over the land, and the clouds flew, and towards evening\nall grew dark, and the leaves fell from the trees, and the water\nrose and roared as if it were boiling, and splashed upon the\nshore.  And in the distance he saw ships which were firing guns\nin their sore need, pitching and tossing on the waves.  And yet\nin the midst of the sky there was still a small patch of blue,\nthough on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm.  So,\nfull of despair, he went and stood in much fear and said,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.\n          For my wife, good ilsabil,\n          wills not as I'd have her will.\nWell, what does she want, now, said the flounder.  Alas, said the\nman, she wants to be pope.  Go to her then, said the flounder,\nshe is pope already.\nSo he went, and when he got there, he saw what seemed to be a\nlarge church surrounded by palaces.  He pushed his way through\nthe crowd.  Inside, however, everything was lighted up with\nthousands and thousands of candles, and his wife was clad in\ngold, and she was sitting on a much higher throne, and had three\ngreat golden crowns on, and round about her there was much\necclesiastical splendor.  And on both sides of her was a row of\ncandles the largest of which was as tall as the very tallest tower,\ndown to the very smallest kitchen candle, and all the emperors\nand kings were on their knees before her, kissing her shoe.\nWife, said the man, and looked attentively at her, are you now\npope.  Yes, said she, I am pope.  So he stood and looked at her,\nand it was just as if he was looking at the bright sun.  When he\nhad stood looking at her thus for a short time, he said, ah,\nwife, if you are pope, do let well alone.  But she looked as\nstiff as a post, and did not move or show any signs of life.\nThen said he, wife, now that you are pope, be satisfied, you\ncannot become anything greater now.  I will consider about that,\nsaid the woman.  Thereupon they both went to bed, but she was\nnot satisfied, and greediness let her have no sleep, for she\nwas continually thinking what there was left for her to be.\nThe man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a great\ndeal during the day.  But the woman could not fall asleep at\nall, and flung herself from one side to the other the whole\nnight through, thinking always what more was left for her to\nbe, but unable to call to mind anything else.  At length the\nsun began to rise, and when the woman saw the red of dawn,\nshe sat up in bed and looked at it.  And when, through the\nwindow, she saw the sun thus rising, she said, cannot I, too,\norder the sun and moon to rise.  Husband, she said, poking him\nin the ribs with her elbows, wake up.  Go to the flounder, for\nI wish to be even as God is.  The man was still half asleep,\nbut he was so horrified that he fell out of bed.  He thought\nhe must have heard amiss, and rubbed his eyes, and said, wife,\nwhat are you saying.  Husband, said she, if I can't order the\nsun and moon to rise, and have to look on and see the sun\nand moon rising, I can't bear it.  I shall not know what it is\nto have another happy hour, unless I can make them rise myself.\nThen she looked at him so terribly that a shudder ran over\nhim, and said, go at once.  I wish to be like unto God.  Alas,\nwife, said the man, falling on his knees before her, the flounder\ncannot do that.  He can make an emperor and a pope.  I beseech\nyou, go on as you are, and be pope.  Then she fell into a\nrage, and her hair flew wildly about her head, she tore open her\nbodice, kicked him with her foot, and screamed, I can't stand\nit, I can't stand it any longer.  Will you go this instant.\nThen he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.  But\noutside a great storm was raging, and blowing so hard that he\ncould scarcely keep his feet.  Houses and trees toppled over,\nthe mountains trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was\npitch black, and it thundered and lightened, and the sea came\nin with black waves as high as church-towers and mountains, and\nall with crests of white foam at the top.  Then he cried, but\ncould not hear his own words,\n          flounder, flounder in the sea,\n          come, I pray thee, here to me.\n          For my wife, good ilsabil,\n          wills not as I'd have her will.\nWell, what does she want, now, said the flounder.  Alas, said\nhe, she wants to be like unto God.  Go to her, and you will\nfind her back again in the pig-stye.  And there they are still\nliving to this day.\n"
