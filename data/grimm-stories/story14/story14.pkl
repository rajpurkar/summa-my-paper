S"A tailor becomes lost in the woods and finds a room where a miniature castle made in great detail is stored in a glass box. Vases full of a bluish vapor line the walls of the room. There is also a glass case where a beautiful maiden lies sleeping. As he looks at her, she opens her eyes and asks him to unbolt the glass case. She tells him she was placed under a curse because she refused to marry a certain man. The maid asks the tailor to help her move the glass box containing the castle to a rock where it will be lifted to ground level. As soon as it is on the ground and the box opened, the castle returns to its proper size. The bottles of bluish vapor are opened and people who were the maid's servants come..."

S"Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things\nand win high honors.  All that is needed is that he should go to\nthe right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he\nshould have good luck.  A civil, smart tailor's apprentice\nonce went out traveling, and came into a great forest, and,\nas he did not know the way, he lost himself.  Night fell and\nnothing was left for him to do in this painful solitude, but to\nseek a bed.  He might certainly have found a good bed on the\nsoft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest\nthere, and at last he made up his mind to spend the night in\na tree.  He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it,\nand thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise\nthe wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried\nhim away.\nAfter he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear\nand trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a\nlight, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there,\nwhere he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he\ngot carefully down and went towards the light.  It guided him\nto a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes.  He\nknocked\nboldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw\na little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored\nstuff sewn together.  Who are you, and what do you want, asked\nthe man in a grumbling voice.  I am a poor tailor, he answered,\nwhom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly\nbeg you to take me into your hut until morning.  Go your way,\nreplied the old man in a surly voice, I will have nothing to do\nwith tramps, seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere.  Having said\nthis, he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor\nheld him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so\npiteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he\nwished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the\nhut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then offered\nhim a very good bed in a corner.\nThe weary tailor needed no rocking, but slept sweetly till morning,\nbut even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had\nnot been aroused by a great noise.  A violent sound of screaming\nand roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut.\nThe tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes\non in haste, and hurried out.  Then close by the hut, he saw\na great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just\npreparing for a violent struggle.  They rushed at each other with\nsuch extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling,\nand the air resounded with their cries.  For a long time it\nwas uncertain which of the two would gain the victory, at\nlength the stag thrust his horns into his adversary's body,\nwhereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and\nwas finished off by a few strokes from the stag.\nThe tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was\nstill standing there motionless, when the stag in full career\nbounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up\non his great horns.  He had not much time to collect his thoughts,\nfor it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and\nvalley, wood and meadow.  He held with both hands to the ends\nof the horns, and resigned himself to his fate.  It seemed\nto him just as if he were flying away.  At length the stag\nstopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor\ndown.  The tailor, more dead than alive, required\nsome time to come to himself.  When he had in some degree\nrecovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed\nits horns with such force against a door in the rock, that\nit sprang open.  Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed\na great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight.  The tailor\ndid not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get\nout of this desert and back to human beings again.  Whilst\nhe was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock,\nwhich cried to him, enter without fear, no evil shall befall you.\nHe hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the\nvoice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious\nhall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished\nsquare stones, on each of which were carved signs which were\nunknown to him.  He looked at everything full of admiration,\nand was on the point of going out again, when he once more\nheard the voice which said to him, step on the stone\nwhich lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune\nawaits you.\nHis courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order.\nThe stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down\ninto the depths.  When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked\nround, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the\nformer.  Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire.\nHollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of\ntransparent glass and filled with colored spirit or with a\nbluish vapor.  On the floor of the hall two great glass chests\nstood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity.\nWhen he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure\nlike a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns,\nand a quantity of other good things.  Everything was small, but\nexceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be\ncarved out by a dexterous hand with the greatest precision.\nHe might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration\nof this rarity for some time, had not the voice once more made\nitself heard.  It ordered him to turn round and look at the\nglass chest which was standing opposite.  How his admiration\nincreased when\nhe saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty.  She lay as if\nasleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a\nprecious mantle.  Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness\nof her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to\nand fro, left no doubt that she was alive.  The tailor was\nlooking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly\nopened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him with a shock\nof joy.  Divine providence, cried she, my deliverance is\nat hand.  Quick, quick, help me out of my prison.  If you\npush back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.\nThe tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up\nthe glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall,\nwhere she covered herself with a large cloak.  Then she seated\nherself on a\nstone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had\nimprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, my long-desired\ndeliverer, kind heaven has guided you to me, and put an end\nto my sorrows.  On the self-same day when they end, shall your\nhappiness begin.  You are the husband chosen for me by heaven, and\nshall pass your life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to\noverflowing in every earthly possession.  Seat yourself, and\nlisten to the story of my life.\nI am the daughter of a rich count.  My parents died when I was\nstill in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will\nto my elder brother, by whom I was brought up.  We loved each\nother so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking\nand our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution\nnever to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives.\nIn our house there was no lack of company.  Neighbors and friends\nvisited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to\nevery one.  So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came\nriding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to\nget on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night.\nWe granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us\nin the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation\nintermingled with stories.  My brother liked the stranger so\nmuch that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to\nwhich, after some hesitation, he consented.  We did not rise\nfrom table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to\na room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in\nmy soft bed.  Hardly had I fallen off to sleep, when the sound\nof faint and delightful music awoke me.  As I could not\nconceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid\nwho slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that\nspeech was taken away from me by an unknown force.  I felt as if\na nightmare were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make\nthe very slightest sound.  In the meantime, by the light of\nmy night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two\ndoors which were fast bolted.  He came to me and said, that\nby magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the\nlovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and\nthat he now forced his way through all fastenings with the\nintention of offering his hand and heart.  My dislike of his\nmagic arts was so great, however, that I refused to answer him.\nHe remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with\nthe idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued\nto keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself\nand find means to punish my pride, and left the room.  I\npassed the night in the greatest disquietude, and fell asleep\nonly towards morning.  When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but\ndid not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he\nhad ridden forth with the stranger to the chase at daybreak.\n\nI at once suspected nothing good.  I dressed myself quickly,\nordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one\nservant, rode full gallop to the forest.  The servant fell with\nhis horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its\nfoot.  I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes\nI saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which\nhe led by a cord.  I asked him where he had left my brother, and\nhow he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw\ntears flowing.  Instead of answering me, he began to laugh\nloudly.  I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol\nand discharged it at the monster, but the ball rebounded from\nhis breast and went into my horse's head.  I fell to the ground,\nand the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of\nconsciousness.\nWhen I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground\ncave in a glass coffin.  The magician appeared once again, and\nsaid he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all\nthat belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had\nshut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all\nturned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles.  He\ntold me that if I would now comply with his wish, it would be an\neasy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as\nhe had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would\nreturn once more to its natural form.  I answered him as little\nas I had done the first time.  He vanished and left me in my\nprison, in which a deep sleep came on me.\nAmong the visions which passed before my eyes, the most\ncomforting was that in which a young man came and set me free,\nand when I opened my eyes to-day I saw you, and beheld my\ndream fulfilled.  Help me to accomplish the other things\nwhich happened in those visions.  The first is that we lift the\nglass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone.\nAs soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with\nthe maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening\nof the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could\neasily reach the open air.  Here the maiden opened the lid, and\nit was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and\nthe farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out\nand grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity.\nAfter this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath\nthe earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke\ncarried up by the stone.  The maiden had scarcely opened the\nbottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into\nliving men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people.\nHer joy was still more increased when her brother, who had\nkilled the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the\nforest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day\nthe maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the\naltar to the lucky tailor.\n"
