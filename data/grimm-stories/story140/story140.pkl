S"Lean Lisa is as industrious as Lazy Harry and Fat Trina are idle. Lisa works all day long and even at night she does not sleep because she is thinking about how she can get money to buy a cow. Lisa's husband thinks if they buy a cow he will get to drink the milk. Lisa, however, has other plans and her husband finally has to hold Lisa down to make her go to sleep."

S"Lean lisa was of a very different way of thinking from lazy\nharry and fat trina, who never let anything disturb their\npeace.  She slaved away from morning till evening, and\nburdened her husband, long laurence, with so much work that\nhe had heavier weights to carry than an ass with three sacks.\nBut it was\nall to no purpose, for they had nothing and came to nothing.\nOne night as she lay in bed, and could hardly move one limb for\nweariness, she still did not allow her thoughts to go to sleep.\nShe thrust her elbow into her husband's side, and said, listen,\nlenz, to what I have been thinking.  If I were to find one florin\nand one was given to me, I would borrow another to put to them,\nand you too should give me another, and then as soon as I had\ngot the four florins together, I would buy a young cow.  This\npleased the husband right well.  It is true, said he, that I do\nnot know where I am to get the florin which you want as a gift\nfrom me.  But, if you can get the money together, and can buy a\ncow with it, you will do well to carry out your project.  I shall\nbe glad, he added, if the cow has a calf, and then I shall often\nget a drink of milk to refresh me.  The milk is not for you, said\nthe woman, we must let the calf suck that it may become big and\nfat, and we may be able to sell it well.  Certainly, replied the\nman, but still we will take a little milk.  That will do no harm.\nWho has taught you to manage cows,\nsaid the woman.  Whether it does harm or not, I will not allow it,\nand even if you were to stand on your head for it, you should not\nhave a drop of the milk.  Do you think, because there is no\nsatisfying you, long laurence, that you are to eat up what I earn\nwith so much difficulty.  Wife, said the man, be quiet, or I will\ngive you a blow on your mouth.  What, cried she, you threaten me,\nyou glutton, you rascal, you lazy harry.  She was just laying\nhold of his hair, but long laurence got up, seized both lean\nlisa's withered arms in one hand, and with the other he pressed\ndown her head into the pillow, let her scold, and held her until\nshe fell asleep for very weariness.  Whether she continued to\nwrangle when she awoke next morning, or whether she went out to\nlook for the florin which she wanted to find, that I know not.\n"
