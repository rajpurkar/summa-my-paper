S'Three apprentices travel together. They are given a money-making proposition by the devil. The devil gives each of the three apprentices a phrase with which they must answer any question directed at them. They are not allowed to speak any words other than their assigned phrases. They live in an inn where the other residents believe them to be mad. A wealthy merchant stays at the inn overnight and is murdered by the innkeeper. The innkeeper pins the crime on the apprentices until the devil appears and grants the apprentices pardon. The apprentices are allowed to say the innkeeper was the one who murdered the merchant and that there are other murder victims hanging in the basement. The innkeeper is killed and the devil gets his soul. The apprentices are set with money for the rest of their lives. '

S"There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always\ntogether while traveling, and always to work in the same\ntown.  At one time, however, their masters had no more work\nto give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing\nto live on.  Then one of them said, what shall we do.  We cannot\nstay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do\nnot find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with\nthe innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we\nare staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and\nthen we will separate.  And that seemed best to the others also.\nThey went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who\nasked who they were.  We are apprentices looking for work.  Up to\nthis time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything\nto do we are going to separate.  There is no need for that, said\nthe man, if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for\ngold or for work.  Nay, you shall become great lords, and drive\nin your carriages.  One of them said, if our souls and salvation\nbe not endangered, we will certainly do it.  They will not,\nreplied the man,\nI have no claim on you.  One of the others, however, had looked\nat his feet, and when he saw a horse's foot and a man's foot,\nhe did not want to have anything to do with him.  Then the\ndevil said, be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another\nsoul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall\nbut run full.  As they were now secure, they consented, and the\ndevil told them what he wanted.  The first was to answer,\nall three of us, to every question.  The second was to say,\nfor money, and the third, and quite right too.  They were always\nto say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one\nword more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would\ndisappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets\nwould always be full.  As a beginning, he at once gave them as\nmuch as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such\nan inn when they got to the town.  They went to it, and the\ninnkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for\nanything to eat.  The first replied, all three of us.  Yes,\nsaid the host, that is what I mean.  The second said, for money.\nOf course, said the host.  The third said, and quite right too.\nCertainly it is right, said the host.\nGood meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well\nwaited on.  After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper\ngave the bill to the one who said, all three of us, the second\nsaid, for money, and the third, and quite right too.  Indeed\nit is right, said the host, all three pay, and without money I\ncan give nothing.  They, however, paid even more than he had\nasked.  The lodgers, who were looking on, said, these people must\nbe mad.  Yes, indeed they are, said the host, they are not very\nwise.  So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else\nbut, all three of us, for money, and and quite right too.  But\nthey saw and knew all that was going on.  It so happened that a\ngreat merchant came with a large sum of money, and said, sir\nhost, take care of my money for me, here are three crazy apprentices\nwho might steal it from me.  The host did as he was asked.  As\nhe was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was\nheavy with gold.  Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a\nlodging below, but the merchant received a separate apartment\nupstairs.  When it was midnight, and the host thought that all\nwere asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and\nstruck the rich merchant dead.   And after they had murdered\nhim they went to bed again.  When it was day there was a great\noutcry.  The merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood.  All\nthe guests came running out, but the host said, the three\ncrazy apprentices have done this.  The lodgers confirmed it,\nand said, it can have been no one else.  The innkeeper, however,\nhad them called, and said to them, have you killed the merchant.\nAll three of us, said the first.  For money, said the second.\nAnd the third added, and quite right too.  There now, you hear,\nsaid the host, they confess it themselves.  They were taken to\nprison, therefore, and were to be tried.  When they saw that\nthings were going so seriously, they were after all afraid,\nbut at night the devil came and said, bear it just one day\nlonger, and do not spurn your luck, not one hair of your head\nshall be hurt.\nThe next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said,\nare you the murderers.  All three of us.  Why did you kill the\nmerchant.  For money.  You wicked wretches, you have no\nhorror of your sins.  And quite right too.  They have confessed,\nand are still stubborn, said the judge, lead them to death\ninstantly.  So they were taken out, and the host had to go with\nthem into the circle.  When they were taken hold of by the\nexecutioner's men, and were just going to be led up to the\nscaffold where the hangman was standing with naked sword,\na coach drawn by four chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving\nso fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made\nsigns from the window with a\nwhite handkerchief.  Then said the hangman, it is a pardon\ncoming, and pardon, pardon, was called from the carriage also.\nThen the devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman,\nbeautifully dressed, and said, you three are innocent.  You\nmay now speak, make known what you have seen and heard.  Then\nsaid the eldest, we did not kill the merchant, the murderer\nis standing there in the circle, and he pointed to the innkeeper.\nIn proof of this, go into his cellar, where many others whom he\nhas killed are still hanging.  Then the judge sent the\nexecutioner's men thither, and they found it was as the\napprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this,\nhe caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off.\nThen said the devil to the three, now I have got the soul which\nI wanted to have, and you are free, and have money for the\nrest of your lives.\n"
