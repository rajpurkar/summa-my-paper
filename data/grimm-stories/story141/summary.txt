Three apprentices travel together. They are given a money-making proposition by the devil. The devil gives each of the three apprentices a phrase with which they must answer any question directed at them. They are not allowed to speak any words other than their assigned phrases. They live in an inn where the other residents believe them to be mad. A wealthy merchant stays at the inn overnight and is murdered by the innkeeper. The innkeeper pins the crime on the apprentices until the devil appears and grants the apprentices pardon. The apprentices are allowed to say the innkeeper was the one who murdered the merchant and that there are other murder victims hanging in the basement. The innkeeper is killed and the devil gets his soul. The apprentices are set with money for the rest of their lives.
