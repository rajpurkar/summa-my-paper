S"A woman has three daughters&mdash;one with one eye, one with two eyes, and one with three eyes. She hates the daughter with two eyes. The mother and other sisters are mean to the two-eyed girl. Through the help of an old woman, the two-eyed girl buries a goat's entrails out of which a sliver tree with gold fruit grows. Because she is the only one who can pull a branch from the tree, the girl is married to a knight. The one-eyed and three-eyed sisters eventually wind up at the home of their two-eyed sister, who takes them in and cares for them."

S'There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom\nwas called One-Eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her\nforehead, and the second, Two-Eyes, because she had two eyes like\nother folks, and the youngest, Three-Eyes, because she had three\neyes, and her third eye was also in the center of her forehead.\nHowever, as Two-Eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters\nand her mother could not endure her.  They said to her, "You, with\nyour two eyes, are no better than the common people, you do not\nbelong to us." They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her,\nand gave her nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything\nthat they could to make her unhappy.\n\nIt came to pass that Two-Eyes had to go out into the fields and tend\nthe goat, but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had\ngiven her so little to eat.  So she sat down on a ridge and began to\nweep, and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes.  And\nonce when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing beside\nher, who said, "Why are you weeping, little Two-Eyes?" Two-Eyes\nanswered, "Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes like other\npeople, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push me from\none corner to another, throw old clothes to me, and give me nothing\nto eat but the scraps they leave.  Today they have given me so little\nthat I am still quite hungry." Then the wise woman said, "Wipe away\nyour tears, Two-Eyes, and I will tell you something to stop your ever\nsuffering from hunger again.  Just say to your goat -\n\t `Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,\'\nand then a clean well-spread little table will stand before you with\nthe most delicious food upon it of which you may eat as much as you\nare inclined for, and when you have had enough, and have no more need\nof the little table, just say,\n\t `Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t and take the table quite away,\'\nand then it will vanish again from your sight." Hereupon the wise\nwoman departed.  But Two-Eyes thought, "I must instantly make a\ntrial, and see if what she said is true, for I am far too hungry,"\nand she said -\n\t "Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,"\nand scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered\nwith a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a\nknife and fork, and a silver spoon, and the most delicious food was\nthere also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the\nkitchen.  Then Two-Eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, "Lord God,\nbe our guest forever, amen," and helped herself to some food, and\nenjoyed it.  And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman\nhad taught her -\n\t "Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,"\nand immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.\nThat is a delightful way of keeping house, thought Two-Eyes, and was\nquite glad and happy.\n\nIn the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small\nearthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for\nher, but she did not touch it.  Next day she again went out with her\ngoat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to\nher, lying untouched.  The first and second time that she did this,\nher sisters did not notice it at all, but as it happened every time,\nthey did observe it, and said, "There is something wrong about\nTwo-Eyes, she always leaves her food untasted, and she used to eat up\neverything that was given her, she must have discovered other ways of\ngetting food." In order that they might learn the truth, they\nresolved to send One-Eye with Two-Eyes when she went to drive her\ngoat to the pasture, to observe what Two-Eyes did when she was there,\nand whether anyone brought her anything to eat and drink.\n\nSo when Two-Eyes set out the next time, One-Eye went to her and said,\n"I will go with you to the pasture, and see that the goat is well\ntaken care of, and driven where there is food." But Two-Eyes knew\nwhat was in One-Eye\'s mind, and drove the goat into high grass and\nsaid, "Come, One-Eye, we will sit down, and I will sing something to\nyou." One-Eye sat down and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and\nthe heat of the sun, and Two-Eyes sang constantly -\n\t "One-eye, are you waking?\n\t One-eye, are you sleeping?"\nUntil One-Eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as\nTwo-Eyes saw that One-Eye was fast asleep, and could discover\nnothing, she said,\n\t "Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,"\nand seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was\nsatisfied, and then she again cried -\n\t "Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,"\nand in an instant all had vanished.  Two-Eyes now awakened One-Eye,\nand said, "One-Eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to\nsleep while you are doing it, but in the meantime the goat might run\nall over the world.  Come, let us go home again."\n\nSo they went home, and again Two-Eyes let her dish stand untouched,\nand One-Eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and\nto excuse herself said, "I fell asleep when I was out." Next day the\nmother said to Three-Eyes, this time you shall go and observe if\nTwo-Eyes eats anything when she is out, and if anyone fetches her\nfood and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.  So Three-Eyes\nwent to Two-Eyes, and said, "I will go with you and see if the goat\nis taken proper care of, and driven where there is food." But\nTwo-Eyes knew what was in Three-Eyes\' mind, and drove the goat into\nhigh grass and said, "We will sit down, and I will sing something to\nyou, Three-Eyes." Three-Eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and\nwith the heat of the sun, and Two-Eyes began the same song as before,\nand sang -\n\t "Three-Eyes, are you waking?"\n\nBut then, instead of singing -\n\t "Three-Eyes, are you sleeping?"\n\nAs she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang -\n\t "Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?"\n\nAnd sang all the time -\n\t "Three-Eyes, are you waking?\n\t Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?"\n\nThen two of the eyes which Three-Eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but\nthe third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep.  It\nis true that three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend\nit was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very\nwell.  And when two-eyes thought that three-eyes was fast asleep, she\nused her little charm -\n\t "Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,"\nand ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the\ntable to go away again,\n\t "Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,"\nand Three-Eyes had seen everything.  Then Two-Eyes came to her, waked\nher and said, "Have you been asleep, Three-Eyes?  You keep watch very\nwell.  Come, we will go home." And when they got home, Two-Eyes again\ndid not eat, and Three-Eyes said to the mother, "Now, I know why that\nhaughty thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the\ngoat -\n\t `Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n\t Cover the table with something to eat,\'\nand then a little table appears before her covered with the best of\nfood, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all\nshe wants, she says -\n\t `Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n\t And take the table quite away,\'\nand all disappears.  I watched everything closely.  She put two of my\neyes to sleep by means of a charm, but luckily the one in my forehead\nkept awake."\n\nThen the envious mother cried, "Do you want to fare better than we\ndo?  The desire shall pass from you," and she fetched a butcher\'s\nknife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down\ndead. When Two-Eyes saw that, she went out full of sadness, seated\nherself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept\nbitter tears.  Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side,\nand said, "Two-Eyes, why are you weeping?" "Have I not reason to\nweep?" she answered.  "The goat which covered the table for me every\nday when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I\nshall again have to bear hunger and want." The wise woman said,\n"Two-Eyes, I will give you a piece of good advice, ask your sisters\nto give you the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in\nthe ground in front of the house, and your fortune will be made."\nThen she vanished, and Two-Eyes went home and said to her sisters,\n"Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat, I don\'t wish for what\nis good, but give me the entrails." Then they laughed and said, "If\nthat\'s all you want, you can have it." So Two-Eyes took the entrails\nand buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door,\nas the wise woman had counseled her to do.\n\nNext morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there\nstood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit\nof gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was\nnothing more beautiful or precious.  They did not know how the tree\ncould have come there during the night, but Two-Eyes saw that it had\ngrown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the\nexact spot where she had buried them.  Then the mother said to\nOne-Eye, "Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the\ntree for us." One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold\nof one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and\nthat happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple,\nlet her do what she might.  Then said the mother, "Three-Eyes, you\nclimb up, you with your three eyes can look about you better than\nOne-Eye." One-Eye slipped down, and Three-Eyes climbed up.\nThree-Eyes was not more skillful, and might try as she would, but the\ngolden apples always escaped her.\n\nAt length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but\ncould get hold of the fruit no better than One-Eye and Three-Eyes,\nfor she always clutched empty air.  Then said Two-Eyes, "Let me go\nup, perhaps I may succeed better." The sisters cried, "You indeed,\nwith your two eyes, what can you do?" But Two-Eyes climbed up, and\nthe golden apples did not avoid her, but came into her hand of their\nown accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and\nbrought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away\nfrom her, and instead of treating poor Two-Eyes any better for this,\nshe and One-Eye and Three-Eyes were only envious, because Two-Eyes\nalone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more\ncruelly.\n\nIt so befell that once when they were all standing together by the\ntree, a young knight came up.  "Quick, Two-Eyes," cried the two\nsisters, "creep under this, and don\'t disgrace us," and with all\nspeed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the\ntree over poor Two-Eyes, and they swept the golden apples which she\nhad been gathering, under it too.  When the knight came nearer he was\na handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and\nsilver tree, and said to the two sisters, "To whom does this fine\ntree belong?  Anyone who would bestow one branch of it on me might in\nreturn for it ask whatsoever he desired." Then One-Eye and Three-Eyes\nreplied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him\na branch.  They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do\nit, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time.\nThen said the knight, "It is very strange that the tree should belong\nto you, and that you should not have the power to break a piece off."\nThey again asserted that the tree was their property.\n\nWhilst they were saying so, Two-Eyes rolled out a couple of golden\napples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was\nvexed with One-Eye and Three-Eyes, for not speaking the truth.  When\nthe knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they\ncame from.  One-Eye and Three-Eyes answered that they had another\nsister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two\neyes like any common person.  The knight, however, desired to see\nher, and cried, "Two-Eyes, come forth." Then Two-Eyes, quite\ncomforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised\nat her great beauty, and said, "You, Two-Eyes, can certainly break\noff a branch from the tree for me." "Yes," replied Two-Eyes, "that I\ncertainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me." And she\nclimbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with\nbeautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight.\nThen said the knight, "Two-Eyes, what shall I give you for it?"\n"Alas, answered two-eyes, "I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and\nwant, from early morning till late night.  If you would take me with\nyou, and rescue me, I should be happy." So the knight lifted Two-Eyes\non to his horse, and took her home with him to his father\'s castle,\nand there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her\nheart\'s content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the\nwedding was solemnized with great rejoicing.\n\nWhen Two-Eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two\nsisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. "The wonderful\ntree, however, still remains with us," thought they, "and even if we\ncan gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and\nlook at it, and come to us and admire it.  Who knows what good things\nmay be in store for us." But next morning, the tree had vanished, and\nall their hopes were at an end.  And when Two-Eyes looked out of the\nwindow of her own room, to her great delight it was standing in front\nof it, and so it had followed her.\n\nTwo-Eyes lived a long time in happiness.  Once two poor women came to\nher in her castle, and begged for alms.  She looked in their faces,\nand recognized her sisters, One-Eye, and Three-Eyes, who had fallen\ninto such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread\nfrom door to door.  Two-Eyes, however, made them welcome, and was\nkind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their\nhearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their\nyouth.\n'
