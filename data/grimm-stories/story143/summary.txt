A woman has three daughters&mdash;one with one eye, one with two eyes, and one with three eyes. She hates the daughter with two eyes. The mother and other sisters are mean to the two-eyed girl. Through the help of an old woman, the two-eyed girl buries a goat's entrails out of which a sliver tree with gold fruit grows. Because she is the only one who can pull a branch from the tree, the girl is married to a knight. The one-eyed and three-eyed sisters eventually wind up at the home of their two-eyed sister, who takes them in and cares for them.
