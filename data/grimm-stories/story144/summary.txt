The Lord creates the wolf. The devil creates the goat. The goats' long tails get caught in the hedges so the devil bites off the tails. The goats destroy fruit bearing trees and vines. The Lord sets his wolves on the goats and they are killed. The devil explains to the Lord any animal the devil has created must have the destructive nature of the devil. The Lord then tricks the devil, and in his anger the devil puts out the eyes of all the goats and puts his eyes in the animals instead.
