S"A king's son goes out in the world to entertain himself. At a giant's house he begins playing with the giant's oversized nine-pins and balls. The giant wonders at the prince's unusual strength. He asks the prince to bring an apple from the tree of life for the giant's fiancee. The prince agrees. He arrives at the garden to find the animals that protect it sleeping. He steps over the animals and climbs the fence. After locating the tree of life and climbing it, he inserts his arm through a ring before an apple and takes the apple. The ring clamps down on the prince's arm and gives him superhuman strength. Instead of climbing back over the fence, he shakes the gate from its hinges. The noise wakes the animals and the lion follows the prince..."

S'There was once a king\'s son, who was no longer content to stay at\nhome in his father\'s house, and as he had no fear of anything, he\nthought, I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not\nseem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.  So he took leave of\nhis parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night,\nand whichever way his path led it was the same to him.  It came to\npass that he arrived at the house of a giant, and as he was so tired\nhe sat down by the door and rested. And as he let his eyes roam here\nand there, he saw the giant\'s playthings lying in the yard.  These\nwere a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man.\nAfter a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled\nthe balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins\nfell, and had a merry time of it.\n\nThe giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and\nsaw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his\nnine-pins.  "Little worm," cried he, "why are you playing with my\nballs?  Who gave you strength to do it?" The king\'s son looked up,\nsaw the giant, and said, "Oh, you blockhead, you think indeed that\nyou only have strong arms, I can do everything I want to do." The\ngiant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and\nsaid, "Child of man, if you are one of that kind, go and bring me an\napple of the tree of life." "What do you want with it?" said the\nking\'s son.  "I do not want the apple for myself," answered the\ngiant, "but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it.  I have\ntraveled far about the world and cannot find the tree." "I will soon\nfind it," said the king\'s son, "and I do not know what is to prevent\nme from getting the apple down." The giant said, "You really believe\nit to be so easy.  The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded\nby an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each\nclose to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in." "They\nwill be sure to let me in," said the king\'s son.  "Yes, but even if\nyou do get into the garden, and see the apple hanging to the tree, it\nis still not yours.  A ring hangs in front of it, through which any\none who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand,\nand no one has yet had the luck to do it." "That luck will be mine,"\nsaid the king\'s son. Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth\nover mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at\nlength he came to the wondrous garden.\n\nThe beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and\nwere asleep.  Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them,\nso he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the\ngarden.  There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and\nthe red apples were shining upon the branches.  He climbed up the\ntrunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he\nsaw a ring hanging before it, but he thrust his hand through that\nwithout any difficulty, and picked the apple.  The ring closed\ntightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength\nflowing through his veins.  When he had come down again from the tree\nwith the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the\ngreat gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it\nsprang open with a loud crash.  Then he went out, and the lion which\nhad been lying in front of the gate, was awake and sprang after him,\nnot in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master.\n\nThe king\'s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and\nsaid, "You see, I have brought it without difficulty." The giant was\nglad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his\nbride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished.  She was a\nbeautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his\narm, she said, "I shall never believe that you have brought the\napple, until I see the ring on your arm." The giant said, "I have\nnothing to do but go home and fetch it," and thought it would be easy\nto take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of\nhis own free will.  He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the\nking\'s son refused it.  "Where the apple is, the ring must be also,"\nsaid the giant. "If you will not give it of your own accord, you must\nfight me for it."\n\nThey wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could\nnot harm the king\'s son, who was strengthened by the magical power of\nthe ring.  Then the giant thought of a ruse, and said, "I have got\nwarm with fighting, and so have you.  We will bathe in the river, and\ncool ourselves before we begin again." The king\'s son, who knew\nnothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with\nhis clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river.\nThe giant instantly snatched the ring, and ran away with it, but the\nlion, which had observed the theft, pursued the giant, tore the ring\nout of his hand, and brought it back to its master.  Then the giant\nplaced himself behind an oak-tree, and while the king\'s son was busy\nputting on his clothes again, surprised him, and put both his eyes\nout.\n\nAnd now the unhappy king\'s son stood there, and was blind and knew\nnot how to help himself.  Then the giant came back to him, took him\nby the hand as if he were someone who wanted to guide him, and led\nhim to the top of a high rock.  There he left him standing, and\nthought, "Just two steps more, and he will fall down and kill\nhimself, and I can take the ring from him." But the faithful lion had\nnot deserted its master.  It held him fast by the clothes, and drew\nhim gradually back again.\n\nWhen the giant came and wanted to rob the dead man, he saw that his\ncunning had been in vain.  "Is there no way, then, of destroying a\nweak child of man like that?" said he angrily to himself, and seized\nthe king\'s son and led him back again to the precipice by another\nway, but the lion which saw his evil design, helped its master out of\ndanger here also.  When they had come close to the edge, the giant\nlet the blind man\'s hand drop, and was going to leave him behind\nalone, but the lion pushed the giant so that he was thrown down and\nfell, dashed to pieces, on the ground.\n\nThe faithful animal again drew its master back from the precipice,\nand guided him to a tree by which flowed a clear brook.  The king\'s\nson sat down there, but the lion lay down, and sprinkled the water in\nhis face with its paws.  Scarcely had a couple of drops wetted the\nsockets of his eyes, than he was once more able to see something, and\nnoticed a little bird flying quite close by, which hit itself against\nthe trunk of a tree.  So it went down to the water and bathed itself\ntherein, and then it soared upwards and swept between the trees\nwithout touching them, as if it had recovered its sight.  Then the\nking\'s son recognized a sign from God and stooped down to the water,\nand washed and bathed his face in it.  And when he arose he had his\neyes once more, brighter and clearer than they had ever been.\n\nThe king\'s son thanked God for his great mercy, and traveled with his\nlion onwards through the world.  And it came to pass that he arrived\nbefore a castle which was enchanted.  In the gateway stood a maiden\nof beautiful form and fine face, but she was quite black.  She spoke\nto him and said, "Ah, if you could but deliver me from the evil spell\nwhich is thrown over me." "What shall I do?" said the king\'s son.\nThe maiden answered, "You must pass three nights in the great hall of\nthis enchanted castle, but you must let no fear enter your heart.\nWhen they are doing their worst to torment you, if you bear it\nwithout letting a sound escape you, I shall be free.  Your life they\ndare not take." Then said the king\'s son, "I have no fear, with God\'s\nhelp I will try it." So he went gaily into the castle, and when it\ngrew dark he seated himself in the large hall and waited.\n\nEverything was quiet, however, till midnight, when all at once a\ngreat tumult began, and out of every hole and corner came little\ndevils.  They behaved as if they did not see him, seated themselves\nin the middle of the room, lighted a fire, and began to gamble.  When\none of them lost, he said, "It is not right, some one is here who\ndoes not belong to us, it is his fault that I am losing." "Wait, you\nfellow behind the stove, I am coming," said another.  The screaming\nbecame still louder, so that no one could have heard it without\nterror.  The king\'s son stayed sitting quite calmly, and was not\nafraid, but at last the devils jumped up from the ground, and fell on\nhim, and there were so many of them that he could not defend himself\nfrom them.  They dragged him about on the floor, pinched him, pricked\nhim, beat him, and tormented him, but no sound escaped from him.\nTowards morning they disappeared, and he was so exhausted that he\ncould scarcely move his limbs, but when day dawned the black maiden\ncame to him.  She bore in her hand a little bottle wherein was the\nwater of life wherewith she washed him, and he at once felt all pain\ndepart and new strength flow through his veins.  She said, "You have\nheld out successfully for one night, but two more lie before you."\nThen she went away again, and as she was going, he observed that her\nfeet had become white.\n\nThe next night the devils came and began their gambling anew.  They\nfell on the king\'s son, and beat him much more severely than the\nnight before, until his body was covered with wounds.  But as he bore\nall quietly, they were forced to leave him, and when dawn appeared,\nthe maiden came and healed him with the water of life.  And when she\nwent away, he saw with joy that she had already become white to the\ntips of her fingers.  And now he had only one night more to go\nthrough, but it was the worst. The devils came again, "Are you still\nthere?" cried they. "You shall be tormented till your breath stops."\nThey pricked him and beat him, and threw him here and there, and\npulled him by the arms and legs as if they wanted to tear him to\npieces, but he bore everything, and never uttered a cry.  At last the\ndevils vanished, but he lay fainting there, and did not stir, nor\ncould he raise his eyes to look at the maiden who came in, and\nsprinkled and bathed him with the water of life.  But suddenly he was\nfreed from all pain, and felt fresh and healthy as if he had awakened\nfrom sleep, and when he opened his eyes he saw the maiden standing by\nhim, snow-white, and fair as day.\n\n"Rise," said she, "and swing your sword three times over the stairs,\nand then all will be delivered." And when he had done that, the whole\ncastle was released from enchantment, and the maiden was a rich\nking\'s daughter.  The servants came and said that the table was set\nin the great hall, and dinner served up. Then they sat down and ate\nand drank together, and in the evening the wedding was solemnized\nwith great rejoicings.\n'
