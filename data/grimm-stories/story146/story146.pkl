S"Once upon a time there lived a king and a queen, who were rich,\nand had everything they wanted, but no children.  The queen\nlamented over this day and night, and said, I am like a field\non which nothing grows.  At last God gave her her wish, but when\nthe child came into the world, it did not look like a human child,\nbut was a little donkey.  When the mother saw that, her lamentations\nand outcries began in real earnest.  She said she would\nfar rather have had no child at all than have a donkey, and that\nthey were to throw it into the water that the fishes might devour\nit.  But the king said, no, since God has sent him he shall be my\nson and heir, and after my death sit on the royal throne, and\nwear the kingly crown.  The donkey, therefore, was brought up\nand grew bigger, and his ears grew up high and straight.  And he\nwas of a merry disposition, jumped about, played and took especial\npleasure in music, so that he went to a celebrated musician and\nsaid, teach me your art, that I may play the lute as well as you do.\nAh, dear little master, answered the musician, that would come\nvery hard to you, your fingers are not quite suited to it, and\nare far too big.  I am afraid the strings would not last.  But\nno excuses were of any use.  The donkey was determined to play the\nlute.  And since he was persevering and industrious, he at last\nlearnt to do it as well as the master himself.  The young lordling\nonce went out walking full of thought and came to a well.  He\nlooked into it and in the mirror-clear water saw his donkey's\nform.  He was so distressed about it, that he went out into the\nwide world and only took with him one faithful companion.  They\ntraveled up and down, and at last they came into a kingdom where\nand old king reigned who had\na single but wonderfully beautiful daughter.  The donkey said,\nhere we will stay, knocked at the gate, and cried, a guest is\nwithout.  Open, that he may enter.  When the gate was not opened,\nhe sat down, took his lute and played it in the most delightful\nmanner with his two fore-feet.  Then the door-keeper opened his\neyes, and gaped, and ran to the king and said, outside by the\ngate sits a young donkey which plays the lute as well as an\nexperienced master.  Then let the musician come to me, said the\nking.  But when a donkey came in, everyone began to laugh at the\nlute-player.  And when the donkey was asked to sit down and eat\nwith the servants, he was unwilling, and said, I am no common\nstable-ass, I\nam a noble one.  Then they said, if that is what you are, seat\nyourself with the soldiers.  No, said he, I will sit by the king.\nThe king smiled, and said good-humoredly, yes, it shall be as\nyou will, little ass, come here to me.  Then he asked, little ass,\nhow does my daughter please you.  The donkey turned his head\ntowards her, looked at her, nodded and said, I like her above\nmeasure, I have never yet seen anyone so beautiful as she is.\nWell, then, you shall sit next her too, said the king.  That is\nexactly what I wish, said the donkey, and he placed himself by her\nside, ate and drank, and knew how to behave himself daintily\nand cleanly.  When the noble beast had stayed a long time at the\nking's court, he thought, what good does all this do me, I\nshall still have to go home again, let his head hang sadly,\nand went to the king and asked for his dismissal.  But the king\nhad grown fond of him, and said, little ass, what ails you.  You\nlook as sour as a jug of vinegar, I will give you what you want.\nDo you want gold.  No, said the donkey, and shook his head.\nDo you want jewels and rich dress.  No.  Do you wish for half my\nkingdom.  Indeed, no.  Then said the king, if I did but know what\nwould make you content.  Will you have my pretty daughter to wife.\nAh, yes, said the ass, I should indeed like her, and all at once\nhe became quite merry and full of happiness, for that was exactly\nwhat he was wishing for.  So a great and splendid wedding was\nheld.  In the evening, when the bride and bridegroom were led\ninto their bed-room, the king wanted to know if the ass would\nbehave well, and ordered a servant to hide himself there.  When\nthey were both within, the bridegroom bolted the door, looked\naround, and as he believed that they were quite alone, he suddenly\nthrew off his ass's skin, and stood there in the form of a handsome\nroyal youth.  Now, said he, you see who I am, and see also that\nI am not unworthy of you.  Then the bride was glad, and kissed\nhim, and loved him dearly.  When morning came, he jumped up, put\nhis animal's skin on again, and no one could have guessed\nwhat kind of a form was hidden beneath it.  Soon came the old king.\nAh, cried he, so the little ass is already up.  But surely you are\nsad, said he to his daughter, that you have not got a proper\nman for your husband.  Oh, no, dear father, I love him as well as\nif he were the handsomest in the world, and I will keep him as long\nas I live.  The king was surprised, but the servant who had\nconcealed himself came and revealed everything to him.  The king\nsaid, that cannot be true.  Then watch yourself the next night,\nand you will see it with your own eyes, and hark you, lord king,\nif you were to take his skin away and throw it in the fire, he\nwould be forced to show himself in his true shape.  Your advice is\ngood, said the king, and at night when they were asleep, he stole\nin, and when he got to the bed he saw by the light of the moon\na noble-looking youth lying there, and the skin lay stretched on\nthe ground.  So he took it away, and had a great fire lighted\noutside, and threw the skin into it, and remained by it himself\nuntil it was all burnt to ashes.  But since he was anxious to know\nhow the robbed man would behave himself, he stayed awake the whole\nnight and watched.  When the youth had slept his fill, he got\nup by the first light of morning, and wanted to put on the\nass's skin, but it was not to be found.  At this he was alarmed,\nand, full of grief and anxiety, said, now I shall have to contrive\nto escape.  But when he went out, there stood the king, who said,\nmy son, whither away in such haste.  What have you in mind.  Stay\nhere, you are such a handsome man, you shall not go away from me.\nI will now give you half my kingdom, and after my death you shall\nhave the whole of it.  Then I hope that what begins so well may\nend well, and I will stay with you, said the youth.  And the old\nman gave him half the kingdom, and in a year's time, when he died,\nthe youth had the whole, and after the death of his father he had\nanother kingdom as well, and lived in all magnificence.\n"
