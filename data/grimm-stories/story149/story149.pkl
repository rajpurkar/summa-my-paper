S"There were once upon a time a king and a queen who lived\nhappily together and had twelve children, but they were\nall boys.  Then said the king to his wife, if the thirteenth\nchild which you are about to bring into the world, is a girl, the\ntwelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great,\nand that the kingdom may fall to her alone.  He even caused twelve\ncoffins to be made, which were already filled with shavings, and\nin each lay a little death pillow, and he had them taken into a\nlocked-up room, and then he gave the queen the key of it, and bade\nher not to speak of this to anyone.\n\nThe mother, however, now sat and lamented all day long, until\nthe youngest son, who was always with her, and whom she had\nnamed benjamin, from the bible, said to her, dear mother, why\nare you so sad.\n\nDearest child, she answered, I may not tell you.  But he let\nher have no rest until she went and unlocked the room, and showed\nhim the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings.  Then she said,\nmy dearest benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for\nyou and for your eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into\nthe world, you are all to be killed and buried in them.  And as she\nwept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, weep\nnot, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence.  But she\nsaid, go forth into the forest with your eleven brothers, and let\none sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep\nwatch, looking towards the tower here in the castle.  If I give\nbirth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may\nventure to come back.  But if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red\nflag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the\ngood God protect you.  And every night I will rise up and pray for\nyou - in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and\nin summer that you may not faint away in the heat.\n\nAfter she had blessed her sons therefore, they went forth into\nthe forest.  They each kept watch in turn, and sat on the highest\noak and looked towards the tower.  When eleven days had passed\nand the turn came to benjamin, he saw that a flag was being raised.\nIt was, however, not the white, but the blood-red flag which\nannounced that they were all to die.  When the brothers heard that,\nthey were very angry and said, are we all to suffer death for the\nsake of a girl.  We swear that we will avenge ourselves -\nwheresoever we find a girl, her red blood shall flow.\n\nThereupon they went deeper into the forest, and in the midst\nof it, where it was the darkest, they found a little bewitched hut,\nwhich was standing empty.  Then said they, here we will dwell,\nand you benjamin, who are the youngest and weakest, you shall\nstay at home and keep house, we others will go out and fetch food.\n\nThen they went into the forest and shot hares, wild deer, birds and\npigeons, and whatsoever there was to eat.  This they took to\nbenjamin, who had to dress it for them in order that they might\nappease their hunger.  They lived together ten years in the little\nhut, and the time did not appear long to them.\n\nThe little daughter which their mother the queen had given\nbirth to, was now grown up.  She was good of heart, and fair of\nface, and had a golden star on her forehead.  Once, on a great\nwashing, she saw twelve men's shirts among the things, and asked her\nmother, to whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far\ntoo small for father.  Then the queen answered with a heavy\nheart, dear child, these belong to your twelve brothers.  Said the\nmaiden, where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard\nof them.  She replied, God knows where they are, they are\nwandering about the world.  Then she took the maiden and opened\nthe chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the\nshavings, and the death pillows.  These coffins, said she,\nwere destined for your brothers, who went away secretly before you\nwere born, and she related to her how everything had happened.\nThen said the maiden, dear mother, weep not, I will go and seek\nmy brothers.\n\nSo she took the twelve shirts and went forth, and straight into\nthe great forest.  She walked the whole day, and in the evening she\ncame to the bewitched hut.  Then she entered it and found a young\nboy, who asked, from whence do you come, and whither are you\nbound, and was astonished that she was so beautiful, and wore\nroyal garments, and had a star on her forehead.  And she answered,\nI am a king's daughter, and am seeking my twelve brothers, and\nI will walk as far as the sky is blue until I find them.  And she\nshowed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.  Then\nbenjamin saw that she was his sister, and said, I am benjamin, your\nyoungest brother.  And she began to weep for joy, and benjamin\nwept also, and they kissed and embraced each other with the\ngreatest love.  But after this he said, dear sister, there is still\none difficulty.  We have agreed that every maiden whom we meet\nshall die, because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on\naccount of a girl.  Then said she, I will willingly die, if by so\ndoing I can save my twelve brothers.\n\nNo, answered he, you shall not die.  Seat yourself beneath this\ntub until our eleven brothers come, and then I will soon come to\nan agreement with them.\n\nShe did so, and when it was night the others came from hunting,\nand their dinner was ready.  And as they were sitting at table, and\neating, they asked, what news is there.  Said benjamin, don't\nyou know anything.  No, they answered.  He continued, you have\nbeen in the forest and I have stayed at home, and yet I know\nmore than you do.  Tell us then, they cried.  He answered, but\npromise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed.\n\nYes, they all cried, she shall have mercy, only do tell us.\nThen said he, our sister is here, and he lifted up the tub, and\nthe king's daughter came forth in her royal garments with the\ngolden star on her forehead, and she was beautiful, delicate and\nfair.  Then they were all rejoiced, and fell on her neck, and kissed\nand loved her with all their hearts.\n\nNow she stayed at home with benjamin and helped him with\nthe work.  The eleven went into the forest and caught game, and\ndeer, and birds, and wood-pigeons that they might have food, and\nthe little sister and benjamin took care to make it ready for them.\nShe sought for the wood for cooking and herbs for vegetables, and\nput the pans on the fire so that the dinner was always ready when\nthe eleven came.  She likewise kept order in the little house, and\nput beautifully white clean coverings on the little beds and the\nbrothers were always contented and lived in great harmony with her.\n\nOnce upon a time the two at home had prepared a wonderful\nfeast, and when they were all together, they sat down and ate and\ndrank and were full of gladness.  There was, however, a little\ngarden belonging to the bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily\nflowers, which are likewise called student-lilies.  She wished to\ngive her brothers pleasure, and plucked the twelve flowers, and\nthought she would present each brother with one while at dinner.\nBut at the self-same moment that she plucked the flowers the twelve\nbrothers were changed into twelve ravens, and flew away over the\nforest, and the house and garden vanished likewise.  And now the\npoor maiden was alone in the wild forest, and when she looked\naround, an old woman was standing near her who said, my child,\nwhat have you done.  Why did you not leave the twelve white\nflowers growing.  They were your brothers, who are now forevermore\nchanged into ravens.  The maiden said, weeping, is there no way of\nsaving them.\n\nNo, said the woman, there is but one in the whole world, and\nthat is so hard that you will not save them by it, for you must be\ndumb for seven years, and may not speak or laugh, and if you speak\none single word, and only an hour of the seven years is wanting, all\nis in vain, and your brothers will be killed by the one word.\n\nThen said the maiden in her heart, I know with certainty that\nI shall set my brothers free, and went and sought a high tree and\nseated herself in it and spun, and neither spoke nor laughed.  Now\nit so happened that a king was hunting in the forest, who had a\ngreat greyhound which ran to the tree on which the maiden was\nsitting, and sprang about it, whining, and barking at her.  Then\nthe king came by and saw the beautiful king's daughter with the\ngolden star on her brow, and was so charmed with her beauty that\nhe called to ask her if she would be his wife.  She made no answer,\nbut nodded a little with her head.  So he climbed up the tree\nhimself, carried her down, placed her on his horse, and bore her\nhome.  Then the wedding was solemnized with great magnificence and\nrejoicing, but the bride neither spoke nor smiled.  When they had\nlived happily together for a few years, the king's mother, who was\na wicked woman, began to slander the young queen, and said to\nthe king, this is a common beggar girl whom you have brought\nback with you.  Who knows what wicked tricks she practises secretly.\nEven if she be dumb, and not able to speak, she still might\nlaugh for once.  But those who do not laugh have bad consciences.\n\nAt first the king would not believe it, but the old woman urged this\nso long, and accused her of so many evil things, that at last the\nking let himself be persuaded and sentenced her to death.\nAnd now a great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she\nwas to be burnt, and the king stood above at the window and\nlooked on with tearful eyes, because he still loved her so much.\nAnd when she was bound fast to the stake, and the fire was licking\nat her clothes with its red tongue, the last instant of the seven\nyears expired.  Then a whirring sound was heard in the air, and\ntwelve ravens came flying towards the place, and sank downwards, and\nwhen they touched the earth they were her twelve brothers, whom\nshe had saved.  They tore the fire asunder, extinguished the flames,\nset their dear sister free, and kissed and embraced her.  And now\nas she dared to open her mouth and speak, she told the king why she\nhad been dumb, and had never laughed.  The king rejoiced when\nhe heard that she was innocent, and they all lived in great unity\nuntil their death.  The wicked step-mother was taken before the\njudge, and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous\nsnakes, and died an evil death.\n"
