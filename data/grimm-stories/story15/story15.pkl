S"There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair, and sold\nher for seven talers.  On the way home he had to pass a pond, and\nalready from afar he heard the frogs crying, aik, aik, aik, aik.\nWell, said he to himself, they are talking without rhyme or reason,\nit is seven that I have received, not eight. When he got to the\nwater, he cried to them, stupid animals that you are.  Don't you know\nbetter than that.  It is seven thalers and not eight.  The frogs,\nhowever, stuck to their, aik aik, aik, aik.  Come, then, if you won't\nbelieve it, I can count it out to you.  And he took his money out of\nhis pocket and counted out the seven talers, always reckoning four\nand twenty groschen to a taler.  The frogs, however, paid no\nattention to his reckoning, but still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik.\nWhat, cried the peasant, quite angry, if you know better than I,\ncount it yourselves, and threw all the money at them into the water.\nHe stood still and wanted to wait until they were through and had\nreturned to him what was his, but the frogs maintained their opinion\nand cried continually, aik, aik, aik, aik.  And besides that, did not\nthrow the money out again.  He still waited a long while until\nevening came on and he was forced to go home. Then he abused the\nfrogs and cried, you water-splashers, you thick-heads, you\ngoggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt\none's ears, but you cannot count seven talers.  Do you think I'm\ngoing to stand here till you get through.  And with that he went\naway, but the frogs still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik, after him till\nhe went home sorely vexed. After a while he bought another cow, which\nhe slaughtered, and he made the calculation that if he sold the meat\nwell he might gain as much as the two cows were worth, and have the\nhide into the bargain.  When therefore he got to the town with the\nmeat, a great pack of dogs were gathered together in front of the\ngate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the\nmeat, sniffed at it, and barked, wow, wow, wow.  As there was no\nstopping him, the peasant said to him, yes, yes, I know quite well\nthat you are saying wow, wow, wow, because you want some of the meat,\nbut I should be in a fine state if I were to give it to you.  The\ndog, however, answered nothing but wow, wow.  Will you promise not to\ndevour it all then, and will you go bail for your companions.  Wow,\nwow, wow, said the dog.  Well, if you insist on it, I will leave it\nfor you, I know you well, and know whom you serve, but this I tell\nyou, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with\nyou, you can just bring it out to me.  Thereupon he unloaded the meat\nand turned back again.  The dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, wow,\nwow. The countryman, who heard them from afar, said to himself, hark,\nnow they all want some, but the big one is responsible to me for it.\nWhen three days had passed, the countryman thought, to-night my money\nwill be in my pocket, and was quite delighted.  But no one would come\nand pay it.  There is no trusting any one now, said he. At last he\nlost patience, and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his\nmoney.  The butcher thought it was a joke, but the peasant said,\njesting apart, I will have my money.  Did not the big dog bring you\nthe whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago.  Then the butcher\ngrew angry, snatched a broomstick and drove him out.  Wait, said the\npeasant, there is still some justice in the world, and went to the\nroyal palace and begged for an audience.  He was led before the king,\nwho sat there with his daughter, and asked him what injury he had\nsuffered.  Alas, said he, the frogs and the dogs have taken from me\nwhat is mine, and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick.  And\nhe related at full length what had happened.  Thereupon the king's\ndaughter began to laugh heartily, and the king said to him, I cannot\ngive you justice in this, but you shall have my daughter to wife for\nit - in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done\nat you, and I have promised her to him who could make her laugh.  You\nmay thank God for your good fortune. Oh, answered the peasant, I do\nnot want her at all.  I have a wife already, and she is one too many\nfor me, when I go home, it is just as if I had a wife standing in\nevery corner.  Then the king grew angry, and said, you are a boor.\nAh, lord king, replied the peasant, what can you expect from an ox,\nbut beef.  Stop, answered the king, you shall have another reward.\nBe off now, but come back in three days, and then you shall have five\nhundred counted out in full. When the peasant went out by the gate,\nthe sentry said, you have made the king's daughter laugh, so you will\ncertainly receive something good.  Yes, that is what I think,\nanswered the peasant, five hundred are to be counted out to me.\nListen, said the soldier, give me some of it.  What can you do with\nall that money.  As it is you, said the peasant, you shall have two\nhundred,  present yourself in three days, time before the king, and\nlet it be paid to you.  A Jew, who was standing by and had heard the\nconversation, ran after the peasant, held him by the coat, and said,\noh, wonder of God, what a child of fortune you are. I will change it\nfor you, I will change it for you into small coins, what do you want\nwith the great talers.  Jew, said the countryman, three hundred can\nyou still have, give it to me at once in coin, in three days from\nthis, you will be paid for it by the king.  The Jew was delighted\nwith the small profit, and brought the sum in bad groschen, three of\nwhich were worth two good ones. After three days had passed,\naccording to the king's command, the peasant went before the king.\nPull his coat off, said the latter, and he shall have his five\nhundred.  Ah, said the peasant, they no longer belong to me, I\npresented two hundred of them to the sentry, and three hundred the\nJew has changed for me, so by right nothing at all belongs to me.  In\nthe meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they\nhad gained from the peasant, and they received the blows strictly\ncounted out.  The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it\ntasted, but the Jew said sorrowfully, alas, alas, are these the heavy\ntalers.  The king could not help laughing at the peasant, and when\nall his anger was spent, he said, as you have already lost your\nreward before it fell to your lot, I will give you compensation.  Go\ninto my treasure chamber and get some money for yourself, as much as\nyou will.  The peasant did not need to be told twice, and stuffed\ninto his big pockets whatsoever would go in.  Afterwards he went to\nan inn and counted out his money. The Jew had crept after him and\nheard how he muttered to himself, that rogue of a king has cheated me\nafter all, why could he not have given me the money himself, and then\nI should have known what I had.  How can I tell now if what I have\nhad the luck to put in my pockets is right or not.  Good heavens,\nsaid the Jew to himself, that man is speaking disrespectfully of our\nlord the king, I will run and inform, and then I shall get a reward,\nand he will be punished as well. When the king heard of the peasant's\nwords he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring\nthe offender to him.  The Jew ran to the peasant, you are to go at\nonce to the lord king in the very clothes you have on.  I know what's\nright better than that, answered the peasant, I shall have a new coat\nmade first. Do you think that a man with so much money in his pocket\nshould go there in his ragged old coat.  The Jew, as he saw that the\npeasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if\nthe king's anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the\npeasant his punishment, said, I will out of pure friendship lend you\na coat for the short time.  What people will not do for love.  The\npeasant was contented with this, put the Jew's coat on, and went off\nwith him. The king reproached the countryman because of the evil\nspeaking of which the Jew had informed him.  Ah, said the peasant,\nwhat a Jew says is always false - no true word ever comes out of his\nmouth.  That rascal there is capable of maintaining that I have his\ncoat on. What is that, shrieked the Jew, is the coat not mine.  Have\nI not lent it to you out of pure friendship, in order that you might\nappear before the lord king.  When the king heard that, he said, the\nJew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us, either myself or\nthe peasant.  And again he ordered something to be counted out to him\nin hard thalers.  The peasant, however, went home in the good coat,\nwith the good money in his pocket, and said to himself, this time I\nhave made it.\n"
