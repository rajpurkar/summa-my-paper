S'In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child,\nand three apprentices served under him.  As they had been with him\nseveral years, he one day said to them, "I am old, and want to sit\nbehind the stove.  Go out, and whichsoever of you brings me the best\nhorse home, to him will I give the mill, and in return for it he\nshall take care of me till my death."\n\nThe third of the boys, however, was the dunce, who was looked on as\nfoolish by the others, they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards\nhe would not even have it.  Then all three went out together, and\nwhen they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, "You may\njust as well stay here, as long as you live you will never get a\nhorse." Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they\ncame to a cave in which they lay down to sleep.  The two smart ones\nwaited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away\nleaving him where he was.  And they thought they had done a very\nclever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them.\n\nWhen the sun rose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern.\nHe looked around on every side and exclaimed, "Oh, heavens, where am\nI?" Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the\nforest, and thought, "Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I\nobtain a horse now?" Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he\nmet a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, "Hans, where are you\ngoing?" "Alas, you can not help me." "I well know your desire," said\nthe cat.  "You wish to have a beautiful horse.  Come with me, and be\nmy faithful servant for seven years long, and then I will give you\none more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life."\n"Well, this is a strange cat," thought Hans, "But I am determined to\nsee if she is telling the truth."\n\nSo she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were\nnothing but kittens who were her servants.  They leapt nimbly\nupstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy.  In the evening\nwhen they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music.  One\nplayed the bass viol, the other the fiddle, and the third put the\ntrumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly\ncould.  When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat\nsaid, "Now, Hans, come and dance with me." "No," said he, "I won\'t\ndance with a pussy cat.  I have never done that yet." "Then take him\nto bed," said she to the cats.  So one of them lighted him to his\nbed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last\none of them blew out the candle.  Next morning they returned and\nhelped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his\ngarters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his\nface with her tail.  "That feels very soft," said Hans.\n\nHe, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and\nto do that, he had an axe of silver, and the wedge and saw were of\nsilver and the mallet of copper.  So he chopped the wood small,\nstayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw\nanyone but the tabby-cat and her servants.  Once she said to him, "Go\nand mow my meadow, and dry the grass," and gave him a scythe of\nsilver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him deliver them up again\ncarefully.  So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and\nwhen he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and\nhay to the house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give\nhim his reward.  "No," said the cat, "you must first do something\nmore for me of the same kind.  There is timber of silver, carpenter\'s\naxe, square, and everything that is needful, all of silver - with\nthese build me a small house." Then Hans built the small house, and\nsaid that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse.\n\nNevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six\nmonths.  The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses. "Yes,"\nsaid Hans.  Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she\nhad opened it, there stood twelve horses, - such horses, so bright\nand shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them.  And now\nshe gave him to eat and drink, and said, "Go home, I will not give\nyou your horse now, but in three days, time I will follow you and\nbring it." So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill.\n\nShe, however, had never once given him a new coat, and he had been\nobliged to keep on his dirty old smock, which he had brought with\nhim, and which during the seven years had everywhere become too small\nfor him.  When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there\nagain as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with\nhim, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame.  They asked\nHans where his horse was.  "It will follow me in three days, time."\nThen they laughed and said, "Indeed, stupid Hans, where will you get\na horse?" "It will be a fine one." Hans went into the parlor, but the\nmiller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and\ntorn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in.  So\nthey gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they\nwent to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at\nlast he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a\nlittle hard straw.\n\nIn the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach\ncame with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful\nto see them - and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for\nthe poor miller\'s boy.  And a magnificent princess alighted from the\ncoach and went into the mill, and this princess was the little\ntabby-cat whom poor Hans had served for seven years.  She asked the\nmiller where the miller\'s boy and dunce was.  Then the miller said,\n"We cannot have him here in the mill, for he is so ragged, he is\nlying in the goose-house." Then the king\'s daughter said that they\nwere to bring him immediately.  So they brought him out, and he had\nto hold his little smock together to cover himself.  The servants\nunpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed him, and when\nthat was done, no king could have looked more handsome.  Then the\nmaiden desired to see the horses which the other apprentices had\nbrought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame.\nSo she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the\nmiller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet\nentered his yard. "And that is for the third miller\'s boy," said she.\n"Then he must have the mill," said the miller, but the king\'s\ndaughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his\nmill as well, and took her faithful Hans and set him in the coach,\nand drove away with him.\n\nThey first drove to the little house which he had built with the\nsilver tools, and behold it was a great castle, and everything inside\nit was of silver and gold, and then she married him, and he was rich,\nso rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life.  After this,\nlet no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a\nperson of importance.\n'
