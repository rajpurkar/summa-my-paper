A woman with twelve sons is so poor that she finally feels she must send her children out one by one to look for bread. She prays only that all her children will be alive when the Lord is born. One by one the sons are all taken by a small boy angel to a cavern where they are rocked to sleep. The boys sleep for three hundred years until the time the Lord is born. At this time, they are awakened and serve Him as the twelve apostles.
