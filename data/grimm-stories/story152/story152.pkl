S'About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this\ncountry nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived\non the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting.  Once on a time\nwhen he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen,\nthree girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and\nwhen they saw the king with all his followers, the eldest girl\npointed to him, and called to the two other girls, hullo.  Hullo.\nIf I do not get that one, I will have none.  Then the second\ngirl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to\nthe one who was on the king\'s right hand, hullo.  Hullo.  If\nI do not get him, I will have no one.  These, however, were the\ntwo ministers.  The king heard all this, and when he had come\nback from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought\nto him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the\nmountain.  This they would not tell him, so the king asked\nthe eldest if she really would take him for her husband.  Then\nshe said, yes, and the two ministers married the two sisters,\nfor they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially\nthe queen, who had hair like flax.\n\nBut the two sisters had no children, and once when the king was\nobliged to go from home he invited them to come to the queen\nin order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child.  She\nhad a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world\nwith him.  Then the two sisters said to each other that they\nwould throw the beautiful boy into the water.  When they had\nthrown him in - I believe it was into the Weser - a little\nbird flew up into the air, which sang -\n          to thy death art thou sped\n          until God\'s word be said.\n          In the white lily bloom,\n          brave boy, is thy tomb.\n\nWhen the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and\nran away in great haste.  When the king came home they told him\nthat the queen had been delivered of a dog.  Then the king\nsaid, what God does, is well done.  But a fisherman who\ndwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while\nhe was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared\nhim.\n\nWhen a year had gone by, the king again went away, and\nthe queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters\nlikewise took and threw into the water.  Then up flew a little\nbird again and sang -\n          to thy death art thou sped\n          until God\'s word be said.\n          In the white lily bloom,\n          brave boy, is thy tomb.\n\nAnd when the king came back, they told him that the queen\nhad once more given birth to a dog, and he again said,\nwhat God does, is well done.  The fisherman, however, fished\nthis one also out of the water, and reared him.\n\nThen the king again journeyed forth, and the queen had a\nlittle girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the\nwater.  Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang -\n          to thy death art thou sped\n          until God\'s word be said.\n          In the white lily bloom,\n          bonny girl, is thy tomb.\n\nAnd when the king came home they told him that the queen had\nbeen delivered of a cat.  Then the king grew angry, and ordered\nhis wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up\nfor many long years.\n\nWhen the children had grown up, the eldest once went out with\nsome other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have\nhim with them, and said, go your way, foundling.\n\nHereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if\nthat was true.  The fisherman told him that once when he was\nfishing he had drawn him out of the water.  So the boy said he\nwould go forth and seek his father.  The fisherman, however,\nentreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered,\nand at last the fisherman consented.  Then the boy went on his\nway and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great\nstretch of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing.\n\n"Good day, mother," said the boy.\n\n"Many thanks," said she.\n\n"You will fish long enough before you catch anything."\n\n"And you will seek long enough before you find your father.  How\nwill you get over the water," said the woman.\n\n"God knows."\n\nThen the old woman took him up on her back and carried him\nthrough it, and he sought for a long time, but could not\nfind his father.\n\nWhen a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his\nbrother.  He came to the water, and all fared with him just\nas with his brother.  And now there was no one at home but the\ndaughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last\nshe also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she\nwished to go in search of her brothers.  Then she likewise came\nto the great stretch of water, and she said to the old woman,\n"Good day, mother."\n\n"Many thanks," replied the old woman.\n\n"May God help you with your fishing," said the maiden.  When\nthe old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried\nher over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, "Go, my\ndaughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a\ngreat black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without\neither laughing or looking at it.  Then you will come to a great\nhigh castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall,\nand go straight through the castle, and out again on the other\nside.  There you will see an old fountain out of which a large\ntree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must\ntake down.  Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain,\nand with these two things go back by the same way.  Pick up\nthe wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and\nwhen you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it,\nbut be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me."\n\nThe maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and\non her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each\nother over half the world.  They went together to the place\nwhere the black dog was lying on the road, she struck it in\nthe face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with\nthem to the river.  There the old woman was still standing.  She\nrejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the\nwater, and then she too went away, for now she was freed.  The\nothers, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that\nthey had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the\nwall.\n\nBut the second son could not settle at home, and took his\ncrossbow and went a-hunting.  When he was tired he took his\nflute, and made music.  The king was hunting too, and heard that\nand went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, "Who has given\nyou leave to hunt here?"\n\n"Oh, no one."\n\n"To whom do you belong, then?"\n\n"I am the fisherman\'s son."\n\n"But he has no children."\n\n"If you will not believe, come with me."\n\nThat the king did, and questioned the fisherman, who told\nhim everything, and the little bird on the wall began to\nsing -\n          the mother sits alone\n          there in the prison small,\n          o king of royal blood,\n          these are thy children all.\n          The sisters twain so false,\n          they wrought the children woe,\n          there in the waters deep\n          where the fishermen come and go.\n\nThen they were all terrified, and the king took the bird, the\nfisherman and the three children back with him to the castle,\nand ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife\nout again.  She had grown quite ill and weak, so the daughter\ngave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she\nbecame strong and healthy.  But the two false sisters were\nburnt, and the daughter married the prince.\n'
