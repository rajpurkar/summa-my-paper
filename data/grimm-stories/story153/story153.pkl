S"There was once a man who understood all kinds of arts.  He served in\nwar, and behaved well and bravely, but when the war was over he\nreceived his dismissal, and three farthings for his expenses on the\nway.  Wait, said he, I shall not be content with this. If I can only\nmeet with the right people, the king will yet have to give me all the\ntreasure of the country.\n\nThen full of anger he went into the forest, and saw a man standing\ntherein who had plucked up six trees as if they were blades of corn.\nHe said to him, will you be my servant and go with me.  Yes, he\nanswered, but, first, I will take this little bundle of sticks home\nto my mother, and he took one of the trees, and wrapped it round the\nfive others, lifted the bundle on his back, and carried it away. Then\nhe returned and went with his master, who said, we two ought to be\nable to get through the world very well, and when they had walked on\nfor a short while they found a huntsman who was kneeling, had\nshouldered his gun, and was about to fire.  The master said to him,\nhuntsman, what are you going to shoot.  He answered, two miles from\nhere a fly is sitting on the branch of an oak-tree, and I want to\nshoot its left eye out.\n\nOh, come with me, said the man, if we three are together, we\ncertainly ought to be able to get on in the world.  The huntsman was\nready, and went with him, and they came to seven windmills whose\nsails were turning round with great speed, and yet no wind was\nblowing either on the right or the left, and no leaf was stirring.\nThen said the man, I know not what is driving the windmills, not a\nbreath of air is stirring, and he went onwards with his servants, and\nwhen they had walked two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree who\nwas shutting one nostril, and blowing out of the other.  Good\ngracious.  What are you doing up there.\n\nHe answered, two miles from here are seven windmills.  Look, I am\nblowing them till they turn round.  Oh, come with me, said the man.\nIf we four are together, we shall carry the whole world before us.\nThen the blower came down and went with him, and after a while they\nsaw a man who was standing on one leg and had taken off the other,\nand laid it beside him.  Then the master said, you have arranged\nthings very comfortably to have a rest.\n\nI am a runner, he replied, and to stop myself running far too fast, I\nhave taken off one of my legs, for if I run with both, I go quicker\nthan any bird can fly.  Oh, go with me.  If we five are together, we\nshall carry the whole world before us.\n\nSo he went with them, and it was not long before they met a man who\nwore a cap, but wore it entirely over one ear.  Then the master said\nto him, gracefully, gracefully, don't stick your cap on one ear, you\nlook just like a tom-fool.  I must not wear it otherwise, said he,\nfor if I set my hat straight, a terrible frost comes on, and all the\nbirds in the air are frozen, and drop dead on the ground.  Oh, come\nwith me, said the master. If we six are together, we can carry the\nwhole world before us.\n\nNow the six came to a town where the king had proclaimed that\nwhosoever ran a race with his daughter and won the victory, should be\nher husband, but whosoever lost it, must lose his head.  Then the man\npresented himself and said, I will, however, let my servant run for\nme.  The king replied, then his life also must be staked, so that his\nhead and yours are both set on the victory.  When that was settled\nand made secure, the man buckled the other leg on the runner, and\nsaid to him, now be nimble, and help us to win.  It was fixed that\nthe one who was first to bring some water from a far distant well was\nto be the victor.  The runner received a pitcher, and the king's\ndaughter one too, and they began to run at the same time, but in an\ninstant, when the king's daughter had got a very little way, the\npeople who were looking on could see no more of the runner, and it\nwas just as if the wind had whistled by.  In a short time he reached\nthe well, filled his pitcher with water, and turned back.  Half-way\nhome, however, he was overcome with fatigue, and set his pitcher\ndown, lay down himself, and fell asleep.  But he had made a pillow of\na horse's skull which was lying on the ground, in order that he might\nlie uncomfortably, and soon wake up again.  In the meantime the\nking's daughter, who could also run very well - quite as well as any\nordinary mortal can - had reached the well, and was hurrying back\nwith her pitcher full of water, and when she saw the runner lying\nthere asleep, she was glad and said, my enemy is delivered over into\nmy hands, emptied his pitcher, and ran on.  And now all would have\nbeen lost if by good luck the huntsman had not been standing at the\ntop of the castle, and had not seen everything with his sharp eyes.\n\nThen said he, the king's daughter shall still not prevail against us.\nAnd he loaded his gun, and shot so cleverly, that he shot the horse's\nskull away from under the runner's head without hurting him.  Then\nthe runner awoke, leapt up, and saw that his pitcher was empty, and\nthat the king's daughter was already far in advance.  He did not lose\nheart, however, but ran back to the well with his pitcher, again drew\nsome water, and was at home again even ten minutes before the king's\ndaughter.  Behold, said he, only now have I begun to use my legs.\nWhat I did before did not deserve to be called running.\n\nBut it pained the king, and still more his daughter, that she should\nbe carried off by a common discharged soldier like that. So they took\ncounsel with each other how to get rid of him and his companions.\nThen said the king to her, I have thought of a way.  Don't be afraid,\nthey shall not come back again.  And he said to them, you shall now\nmake merry together, and eat and drink, and he conducted them to a\nroom which had a floor of iron, and the doors also were of iron, and\nthe windows were guarded with iron bars.  There was a table in the\nroom covered with delicious food, and the king said to them, go in,\nand enjoy yourselves.  And when they were inside, he ordered the\ndoors to be shut and bolted.  Then he sent for the cook, and\ncommanded him to make a fire under the room until the iron became\nred-hot.\n\nThis the cook did, and the six who were sitting at table began to\nfeel quite warm, and they thought the heat was caused by the food.\nBut as it became still greater, and they wanted to get out, and found\nthat the doors and windows were bolted, they became aware that the\nking must have an evil intention, and wanted to suffocate them.  He\nshall not succeed, however, said the one with the cap.  I will cause\na frost to come, before which the fire shall be ashamed, and creep\naway.\n\nThen he put his cap on straight, and immediately there came such a\nfrost that all heat disappeared, and the food on the dishes began to\nfreeze.  When an hour or two had passed by, and the king believed\nthat they had perished in the heat, he had the doors opened to behold\nthem himself.  But when the doors were opened, all six were standing\nthere, alive and well, and said that they should very much like to\nget out to warm themselves, for the very food was fast frozen to the\ndishes with the cold.  Then, full of anger, the king went down to the\ncook, scolded him, and asked why he had not done what he had been\nordered to do.  But the cook replied, there is heat enough there,\njust look yourself. Then the king saw that a fierce fire was burning\nunder the iron room, and perceived that there was no getting the\nbetter of the six in this way.\n\nAgain the king considered how to get rid of his unpleasant guests,\nand caused their chief to be brought and said, if you will take gold\nand renounce my daughter, you shall have as much as you will.\n\nOh, yes, lord king, he answered, give me as much as my servant can\ncarry, and I will not ask for your daughter.\n\nOn this the king was satisfied, and the other continued, in fourteen\ndays, I will come and fetch it.  Thereupon he summoned together all\nthe tailors in the whole kingdom, and they were to sit for fourteen\ndays and sew a sack.  And when it was ready, the strong one who could\ntear up trees had to take it on his back, and go with it to the king.\nThen said the king, who can that strong fellow be who is carrying a\nbundle of linen on his back that is as big as a house.  And he was\nalarmed and said, what a lot of gold he can carry away.  Then he\ncommanded a ton of gold to be brought, which took sixteen of his\nstrongest men to carry, but the strong one snatched it up in one\nhand, put it in his sack, and said, why don't you bring more at the\nsame time.  That hardly covers the bottom.  Then, little by little,\nthe king caused all his treasure to be brought thither, and the\nstrong one pushed it into the sack, and still the sack was not half\nfull with it.  Bring more, cried he, these few crumbs don't fill it.\n\nThen seven thousand carts with gold had to be gathered together in\nthe whole kingdom, and the strong one thrust them and the oxen\nharnessed to them into his sack.  I will examine it no longer, said\nhe, but will just take what comes, so long as the sack is but full.\nWhen all that was inside, there was still room for a great deal more.\nThen he said, I will just make an end of the thing.  People do\nsometimes tie up a sack even when it is not full.  So he took it on\nhis back, and went away with his comrades.  When the king now saw how\none single man was carrying away the entire wealth of the country, he\nbecame enraged, and bade his horsemen mount and pursue the six, and\nordered them to take the sack away from the strong one.  Two\nregiments speedily overtook the six, and called out, you are\nprisoners, put down the sack with the gold, or you will be cut to\npieces.  What say you, cried the blower, that we are prisoners.\n\nRather than that should happen, all of you shall dance about in the\nair.  And he closed one nostril, and with the other blew on the two\nregiments.  Then they were driven away from each other, and carried\ninto the blue sky over all the mountains, one here, the other there.\nOne sergeant cried for mercy.  He had nine wounds, and was a brave\nfellow who did not deserve ill treatment.\n\nThe blower stopped a little so that he came down without injury, and\nthen the blower said to him.  Now go home to your king, and tell him\nhe had better send some more horsemen, and I will blow them all into\nthe air.  When the king was informed of this he said, let the rascals\ngo.  There is magic in them.  Then the six conveyed the riches home,\ndivided it amongst them, and lived in content until their death.\n"
