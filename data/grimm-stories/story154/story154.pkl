S"A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn-sacks\nto the mill indefatigably for many a long year.  But his\nstrength was going, and he was growing more and more unfit\nfor work.  Then his master began to consider how he might\nbest save his keep.  But the donkey, seeing that no good wind\nwas blowing, ran away and set out on the road to bremen.  There,\nhe thought, I can surely be a town-musician.  When he had walked\nsome distance, he found a hound lying on the road, gasping like\none who had run till he was tired.  What are you gasping so for,\nyou big fellow, asked the donkey.\nAh, replied the hound, as I am old, and daily grow weaker, and\nno longer can hunt, my master wanted to kill me, so I took to\nflight, but now how am I to earn my bread.\nI tell you what, said the donkey, I am going to bremen, and\nshall be town-musician there.  Go with me and engage yourself\nalso as a musician.  I will play the lute, and you shall beat\nthe kettle-drum.\nThe hound agreed, and on they went.\nBefore long they came to a cat, sitting on the path, with a face\nlike three rainy days.  Now then, old shaver, what has gone\naskew with you, asked the donkey.\nWho can be merry when his neck is in danger, answered the cat.\nBecause I am now getting old, and my teeth are worn to\nstumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than\nhunt about after mice, my mistress wanted to drown me, so I\nran away.  But now good advice is scarce.  Where am I to go.\nGo with us to bremen.  You understand night-music, you\ncan be a town-musician.\nThe cat thought well of it, and went with them.  After this the\nthree fugitives came to a farm-yard, where the cock was sitting\nupon the gate, crowing with all his might.  Your crow goes\nthrough and through one, said the donkey.  What is the matter.\nI have been foretelling fine weather, because it is the day on\nwhich our lady washes the christ-child's little shirts, and\nwants to dry them, said the cock.  But guests are coming for\nsunday, so the housewife has no pity, and has told the cook that\nshe intends to eat me in the soup to-morrow, and this evening\nI am to have my head cut off.  Now I am crowing at the top of\nmy lungs while still I can.\nAh, but red-comb, said the donkey, you had better come away\nwith us.  We are going to bremen.  You can find something better\nthan death everywhere.  You have a good voice, and if we make\nmusic together it must have some quality.\nThe cock agreed to this plan, and all four went on together.\nThey could not reach the city of bremen in one day, however,\nand in the evening they came to a forest where they meant to\npass the night.  The donkey and the hound laid themselves down\nunder a large tree, the cat and the cock settled themselves in\nthe branches.  But the cock flew right to the top, where he was\nmost safe.  Before he went to sleep he looked round on all four\nsides, and thought he saw in the distance a little spark burning.\nSo he called out to his companions that there must be a house\nnot far off, for he saw a light.  The donkey said, if so, we\nhad better get up and go on, for the shelter here is bad.  The\nhound thought too that a few bones with some meat on would do\nhim good.\nSo they made their way to the place where the light was, and\nsoon saw it shine brighter and grow larger, until they came to\na well-lighted robbers, house.  The donkey, as the biggest, went\nto the window and looked in.\nWhat do you see, my grey-horse, asked the cock.  What do I\nsee, answered the donkey.  A table covered with good things to\neat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.\nThat would be the sort of thing for us, said the cock.  Yes,\nyes.  Ah, if only we were there, said the donkey.\nThen the animals took counsel together how they should manage\nto drive away the robbers, and at last they thought of a plan.\nThe donkey was to place himself with his fore-feet upon the\nwindow-ledge, the hound was to jump on the donkey's back, the\ncat was to climb upon the dog, and lastly the cock was to fly\nup and perch upon the head of the cat.\nWhen this was done, at a given signal, they began to perform\ntheir music together.  The donkey brayed, the hound barked,\nthe cat mewed, and the cock crowed.  Then they burst through the\nwindow into the room, shattering the glass.  At this horrible din,\nthe robbers sprang up, thinking no otherwise than that a ghost\nhad come in, and fled in a great fright out into the forest.  The\nfour companions now sat down at the table, well content with\nwhat was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a\nmonth.\nAs soon as the four minstrels had done, they put out the light,\nand each sought for himself a sleeping-place according to his\nnature and what suited him.  The donkey laid himself down upon\nsome straw in the yard, the hound behind the door, the cat upon\nthe hearth near the warm ashes, and the cock perched himself\nupon a beam of the roof.  And being tired from their long walk,\nthey soon went to sleep.\nWhen it was past midnight, and the robbers saw from afar that\nthe light was no longer burning in their house, and all appeared\nquiet, the captain said, we ought not to have let ourselves\nbe frightened out of our wits, and ordered one of them to go\nand examine the house.\nThe messenger finding all still, went into the kitchen to light\na candle, and, taking the glistening fiery eyes of the cat for\nlive coals, he held a lucifer-match to them to light it.  But\nthe cat did not understand the joke, and flew in his face, spitting\nand scratching.  He was dreadfully frightened, and ran to the\nback-door, but the dog, who lay there sprang up and bit his\nleg.  And as he ran across the yard by the dunghill, the donkey\ngave him a smart kick with its hind foot.  The cock, too, who had\nbeen awakened by the noise, and had become lively, cried down\nfrom the beam, cock-a-doodle-doo.\nThen the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain, and\nsaid, ah, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, who\nspat on me and scratched my face with her long claws.  And by\nthe door stands a man with a knife, who stabbed me in the leg.\nAnd in the yard there lies a black monster, who beat me with\na wooden club.  And above, upon the roof, sits the judge, who\ncalled out, bring the rogue here to me.  So I got away as well\nas I could.\nAfter this the robbers never again dared enter the house.\nBut it suited the four musicians of bremen so well that they\ndid not care to leave it any more.  And the mouth of him who\nlast told this story is still warm.\n"
