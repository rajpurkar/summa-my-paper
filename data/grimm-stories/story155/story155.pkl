S"A man returning from war finds himself face to face with the devil. The devil proposes the man not cut his hair or nails, not wash his face and not even pray for seven years. During this time the man is to wear the devil's green coat and a bearskin cape. If the man dies during the seven year period, the devil would win his soul; if not, the man would be free and would be given an endless supply of money. At one inn, Bearskin finds a poor man who is about to starve to death. Bearskin gives the man enough money to care for himself and his three daughters.

S'There was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted\nhimself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets.\nSo long as the war lasted, all went well, but when peace was made, he\nreceived his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he\nliked.  His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he\nwent to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him\nuntil war broke out again.  The brothers, however, were hard-hearted\nand said, "What can we do with you?  You are of no use to us, go and\nmake a living for yourself." The soldier had nothing left but his\ngun, so he took that on his shoulder, and went forth into the world.\n\nHe came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle\nof trees, under these he sat sorrowfully down, and began to think\nover his fate.  I have no money, thought he, I have learnt no trade\nbut that of fighting, and now that they have made peace they don\'t\nwant me any longer, so I see before hand that I shall have to starve.\nAll at once he heard a rustling and when he looked round, a strange\nman stood before him, who wore a green coat and looked right stately,\nbut had a hideous cloven foot.  "I know already what you are in need\nof," said the man, "gold and possessions shall you have, as much as\nyou can make away with, do what you will, but first I must know if\nyou are fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain." "A soldier\nand fear - how can those two things go together?" he answered, "You\ncan put me to the proof." "Very well, then," answered the man, "look\nbehind you." The soldier turned round, and saw a large bear, which\ncame growling towards him.  "Oho," cried the soldier, "I will tickle\nyour nose for you, so that you shall soon lose your fancy for\ngrowling," and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle,\nit fell down and never stirred again.  "I see quite well," said the\nstranger, "that you are not wanting in courage, but there is still\nanother condition which you will have to fulfil." "If it does not\nendanger my salvation," replied the soldier, who knew very well who\nwas standing by him.  "If it does, I\'ll have nothing to do with it."\n"You will look to that for yourself," answered greencoat, "you shall\nfor the next seven years neither wash yourself, nor comb your beard,\nnor your hair, nor cut your nails, nor once say the Lord\'s prayer.  I\nwill give you a coat and a cloak, which during this time you must\nwear.  If you die during these seven years, you are mine, if you\nremain alive, you are free, and rich to boot, for all the rest of\nyour life." The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he\nnow found himself, and as he so often had gone to meet death, he\nresolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms.  The devil\ntook off his green coat, and gave it to the soldier, and said, "If\nyou have this coat on your back and put your hand into the pocket,\nyou will always find it full of money." Then he pulled the skin off\nthe bear and said, "This shall be your cloak, and your bed also, for\nthereon shall you sleep, and and in no other bed shall you lie, and\nbecause of this apparel shall you be called Bearskin." Whereupon the\ndevil vanished.\n\nThe soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found\nthat the thing was really true.  Then he put on the bearskin and went\nforth into the world, and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing\nthat did him good and his money harm.\n\nDuring the first year his appearance was passable, but during the\nsecond he began to look like a monster.  His hair covered nearly the\nwhole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his\nfingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if\ncress had been sown on it, it would have come up.  Whosoever saw him,\nran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he\nmight not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for\neverything he still always found shelter.\n\nIn the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not\nreceive him, and would not even let him have a place in the stable,\nbecause he was afraid the horses would be scared.  But as Bearskin\nthrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats,\nthe host let himself be persuaded and gave him a room in an outhouse.\nBearskin, however, was obliged to promise not to let himself be seen,\nlest the inn should get a bad name.\n\nAs Bearskin was sitting alone in the evening, and wishing from the\nbottom of his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud\nlamenting in a neighboring room.  He had a compassionate heart, so he\nopened the door, and saw an old man weeping bitterly, and wringing\nhis hands.  Bearskin went nearer, but the man sprang to his feet and\ntried to escape from him. At last when the man perceived that\nBearskin\'s voice was human he let himself be prevailed upon, and by\nkind words bearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the\ncause of his grief. His property had dwindled away by degrees, he and\nhis daughters would have to starve, and he was so poor that he could\nnot pay the innkeeper, and was to be put in prison.  "If that is your\nonly trouble," said Bearskin, "I have plenty of money." He caused the\ninnkeeper to be brought thither, paid him and even put a purse full\nof gold into the poor old man\'s pocket.\n\nWhen the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did\nnot know how to show his gratitude.  "Come with me," said he to\nBearskin, "my daughters are all miracles of beauty, choose one of\nthem for yourself as a wife.  When she hears what you have done for\nme, she will not refuse you.  You do in truth look a little strange,\nbut she will soon put you to rights again." This pleased Bearskin\nwell, and he went.  When the eldest saw him she was so terribly\nalarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away.  The second stood\nstill and looked at him from head to foot, but then she said, "How\ncan I accept a husband who no longer has a human form?  The shaven\nbear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me\nfar better, for at any rate it wore a hussar\'s dress and white\ngloves.  If he were only ugly, I might get used to that." The\nyoungest, however, said, "Dear father, that must be a good man to\nhave helped you out of your trouble, so if you have promised him a\nbride for doing it, your promise must be kept." It was a pity that\nBearskin\'s face was covered with dirt and with hair, for if not they\nmight have seen how delighted he was when he heard these words.  He\ntook a ring from his finger, broke it in two, and gave her one half,\nthe other he kept for himself.  Then he wrote his name on her half,\nand hers on his, and begged her to keep her piece carefully. Then he\ntook his leave and said, "I must still wander about for three years,\nand if I do not return then, you are free, for I shall be dead.  But\npray to God to preserve my life."\n\nThe poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when\nshe thought of her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes.\nNothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters.\n"Take care," said the eldest, "if you give him your hand, he will\nstrike his claws into it." "Beware," said the second.  "Bears like\nsweet things, and if he takes a fancy to you, he will eat you up."\n"You must always do as he likes," began the elder again, or else he\nwill growl." And the second continued, "But the wedding will be a\nmerry one, for bears dance well." The bride was silent, and did not\nlet them vex her.  Bearskin, however, traveled about the world from\none place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously\nto the poor that they might pray for him.\n\nAt length, as the last day of the seven years dawned, he went once\nmore out on to the heath, and seated himself beneath the circle of\ntrees.  It was not long before the wind whistled, and the devil stood\nbefore him and looked angrily at him, then he threw bearskin his\ncoat, and asked for his own green one back. "We have not got so far\nas that yet," answered Bearskin, "you must first make me clean."\nWhether the devil liked it or not, he was forced to fetch water, and\nwash Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails.  After this, he\nlooked like a brave soldier, and was much handsomer than he had ever\nbeen before.\n\nWhen the devil had gone away, Bearskin was quite lighthearted. He\nwent into the town, put on a magnificent velvet coat, seated himself\nin a carriage drawn by four white horses, and drove to his bride\'s\nhouse.  No one recognized him.  The father took him for a\ndistinguished general, and led him into the room where his daughters\nwere sitting.  He was forced to place himself between the two eldest,\nwho helped him to wine, gave him the best pieces of meat, and thought\nthat in all the world they had never seen a handsomer man.  The\nbride, however, sat opposite to him in her black dress, and never\nraised her eyes, nor spoke a word.  When at length he asked the\nfather if he would give him one of his daughters to wife, the two\neldest jumped up, ran into their bedrooms to put on splendid dresses,\nfor each of them fancied she was the chosen one.\n\nThe stranger, as soon as he was alone with his bride, brought out his\nhalf of the ring, and threw it in a glass of wine which he handed\nacross the table to her.  She took the wine, but when she had drunk\nit, and found the half ring lying at the bottom, her heart began to\nbeat.  She got the other half, which she wore on a ribbon round her\nneck, joined them, and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly\ntogether.  Then said he, "I am your betrothed bridegroom, whom you\nsaw as Bearskin, but through God\'s grace I have again received my\nhuman form, and have once more become clean." He went up to her,\nembraced her, and gave her a kiss.  In the meantime the two sisters\ncame back in full dress, and when they saw that the handsome man had\nfallen to the share of the youngest, and heard that he was Bearskin,\nthey ran out full of anger and rage.  One of them drowned herself in\nthe well, the other hanged herself on a tree.  In the evening, some\none knocked at the door, and when the bridegroom opened it, it was\nthe devil in his green coat, who said, "You see, I have now got two\nsouls in the place of your one."\n'
