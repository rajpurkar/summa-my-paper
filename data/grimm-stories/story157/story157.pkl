S"There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\nDummling, and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\n\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or\nthirst.\n\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who\nbade him good-day, and said, do give me a piece of cake out of your\npocket, and let me have a draught of your wine, I am so hungry and\nthirsty.  But the clever son answered, if I give you my cake and\nwine, I shall have none for myself, be off with you, and he left the\nlittle man standing and went on.\n\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made\na false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go\nhome and have it bound up.  And this was the little grey man's doing.\n\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave\nhim, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine.  The little old\ngrey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a\ndrink of wine.  But the second son, too, said sensibly enough, what I\ngive you will be taken away from myself, be off, and he left the\nlittle man standing and went on.  His punishment, however, was not\ndelayed, when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself\nin the leg, so that he had to be carried home.\n\nThen Dummling said, father, do let me go and cut wood.  The father\nanswered, your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\nyou do not understand anything about it.  But Dummling begged so long\nthat at last he said, just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\nyourself.  His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in\nthe cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\n\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\nand greeting him, said, give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\nof your bottle, I am so hungry and thirsty.\n\nDummling answered, I have only cinder-cake and sour beer, if that\npleases you, we will sit down and eat.  So they sat down, and when\nDummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and\nthe sour beer had become good wine.  So they ate and drank, and after\nthat the little man said, since you have a good heart, and are\nwilling to divide what you have, I will give you good luck. There\nstands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the\nroots.  Then the little man took leave of him.\n\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a\ngoose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her\nup, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would\nstay the night.  Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose\nand were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and\nwould have liked to have one of its golden feathers.\n\nThe eldest thought, I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\nfeather, and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\n\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\nwas held fast.\n\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\nscreamed out, keep away, for goodness, sake keep away.  But she did\nnot understand why she was to keep away.  The others are there, she\nthought, I may as well be there too, and ran to them, but as soon as\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her.  So\nthey had to spend the night with the goose.\n\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on\nto it.  They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now\nright, wherever his legs took him.\n\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\nprocession he said, for shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are\nyou running across the fields after this young man.  Is that seemly?\nAt the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull\nher away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and\nwas himself obliged to run behind.\n\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson,\nrunning behind three girls.  He was astonished at this and called\nout, hi, your reverence, whither away so quickly.  Do not forget that\nwe have a christening to-day, and running after him he took him by\nthe sleeve, but was also held fast to it. Whilst the five were\ntrotting thus one behind the other, two laborers came with their hoes\nfrom the fields, the parson called out to them and begged that they\nwould set him and the sexton free.  But they had scarcely touched the\nsexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them\nrunning behind Dummling and the goose.\n\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a\ndaughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh.  So he\nhad put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her\nlaugh should marry her.  When Dummling heard this, he went with his\ngoose and all her train before the king's daughter, and as soon as\nshe saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she\nbegan to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop.\n\nThereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife, but the king did\nnot like the son-in-law, and made all manner of excuses and said he\nmust first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine.\n\nDummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help\nhim, so he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had\nfelled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face.\nDummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he\nanswered, I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it, cold water\nI cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me\nis like a drop on a hot stone.\n\nThere, I can help you, said Dummling, just come with me and you shall\nbe satisfied.\n\nHe led him into the king's cellar, and the man bent over the huge\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day\nwas out he had emptied all the barrels.  Then Dummling asked once\nmore for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow,\nwhom everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he\nmade a new condition, he must first find a man who could eat a whole\nmountain of bread.  Dummling did not think long, but went straight\ninto the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was\ntying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying,\nI have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one\nhas such a hunger as I.  My stomach remains empty, and I must tie\nmyself up if I am not to die of hunger.\n\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said, get up and come with me, you\nshall eat yourself full.  He led him to the king's palace, where all\nthe flour in the whole kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a\nhuge mountain of bread to be baked.  The man from the forest stood\nbefore it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain\nhad vanished.  Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride,\nbut the king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could\nsail on land and on water.  As soon as you come sailing back in it,\nsaid he, you shall have my daughter for wife.\n\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\nman to whom he had given his cake.  When he heard what Dummling\nwanted, he said, since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will\ngive you the ship, and I do all this because you once were kind to\nme.  Then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water,\nand when the king saw that, he could no longer prevent him from\nhaving his daughter.  The wedding was celebrated, and after the\nking's death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long\ntime contentedly with his wife.\n"
