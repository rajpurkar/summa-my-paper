One suitor decides to try the feat and the princess goes with him. It is she who falls. The mountain opens up and swallows her. Neither the king nor anyone else is able to rescue her. While in the mountain, the girl falls into the charge of a man named Rinkrank, who forces her to be his servant. She cleans his house while he climbs a ladder out of the mountain, then comes back with silver and gold. One day she tricks Rinkrank into giving her the ladder so she can leave the mountain. She goes back to her father's kingdom where she marries her suitor who is waiting for her. The king kills Rinkrank.
