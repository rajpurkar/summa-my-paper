S"There was once a king's son who had a bride whom he loved very much.\nAnd when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his\nfather lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before\nhis end.  Then he said to his beloved, I must now go and leave you, I\ngive you a ring as a remembrance of me.  When I am king, I will\nreturn and fetch you.\n\nSo he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\ndangerously ill, and near his death.  He said to him, dear son, I\nwished to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I\nwish, and he named a certain king's daughter who was to be his wife.\nThe son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing,\nand said, yes, dear father, your will shall be done, and thereupon\nthe king shut his eyes, and died.\n\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had\ngiven his father, and caused the king's daughter to be asked in\nmarriage, and she was promised to him.  His first betrothed heard of\nthis, and fretted so much about his faithlessness that she nearly\ndied.  Then her father said to her, dearest child, why are you so\nsad.  You shall have whatsoever you will.  She thought for a moment\nand said, dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in\nface, figure, and size.  The father said, if it be possible, your\ndesire shall be fulfilled, and he caused a search to be made in his\nwhole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly\nresembled his daughter in face, figure, and size.\n\nWhen they came to the king's daughter, she had twelve suits of\nhuntsmen's clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\non the huntsmen's clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\n\nThereupon she took leave of her father, and rode away with them, and\nrode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.\nThen she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all\nof them into his service.  The king looked at her and did not know\nher, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said, yes, and that\nhe would willingly take them, and now they were the king's twelve\nhuntsmen.\n\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he\nknew all concealed and secret things.  It came to pass that one\nevening he said to the king, you think you have twelve huntsmen.\nYes, said the king, they are twelve huntsmen. The lion continued, you\nare mistaken, they are twelve girls.\n\nThe king said, that cannot be true.  How will you prove that to me.\nOh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber, answered swered\nthe lion, and then you will soon see.  Men have a firm step, and when\nthey walk over the peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip,\nand drag their feet, and the peas roll about. The king was well\npleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\n\nThere was, however, a servant of the king's who favored the huntsmen,\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went\nto them and repeated everything, and said, the lion wants to make the\nking believe that you are girls.  Then the king's daughter thanked\nhim, and said to her maidens, show some strength, and step firmly on\nthe peas.  So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen\ncalled before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas\nwere lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong,\nsure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred.\n\nThen they went away again, and the king said to the lion, you have\nlied to me, they walk just like men.  The lion said, they have been\ninformed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed\nsome strength.  Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the\nante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and\nthat is what no man would do.  The king liked the advice, and had the\nspinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.\n\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\nand disclosed the project.  So when they were alone the king's\ndaughter said to her eleven girls, show some constraint, and do not\nlook round at the spinning-wheels.  And next morning when the king\nhad his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber,\nand never once looked at the spinning wheels.\n\nThen the king again said to the lion, you have deceived me, they are\nmen, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels. The lion\nreplied, they have learnt that they were going to be put to the test,\nand have restrained themselves.  The king, however, would no longer\nbelieve the lion.\n\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\nliking for them continually increased.  Now it came to pass that once\nwhen they were hunting, news came that the king's bride was\napproaching.  When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much\nthat her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the\nground.  The king thought something had happened to his dear\nhuntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off.\nThen he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when\nhe looked in her face he recognized her.\n\nThen his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened\nher eyes he said, you are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the\nworld can alter that.  He sent a messenger to the other bride, and\nentreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife\nalready, and someone who had found an old key did not require a new\none.  Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again\ntaken into favor, because, after all, he had told the truth.\n"
