S'After finishing seven years of labor, Hans asks for his pay. His master gives him a piece of gold as big as his head. Hans trades this piece of gold for a horse he can ride and rids himself of the heavy piece of gold. Hans believes this to be the best trade until he falls off the horse. Then he trades his horse for a cow and is happy until he finds the cow will not give milk. Hans continues to make trades until he winds up only with a grindstone and a plain stone. He grows weary carrying these stones and sets them on the side of a well so he can get a drink. He accidentally knocks the stones into the water.

S"Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him,\nmaster, my time is up, now I should be glad to go back home to my\nmother, give me my wages.  The master answered, you have served me\nfaithfully and honestly, as the service was so shall the reward be.\nAnd he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head.  Hans pulled his\nhandkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on\nhis shoulder, and set out on the way home.\n\nAs he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a\nhorseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse.  Ah, said\nHans quite loud, what a fine thing it is to ride.  There you sit as\non a chair, you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and\ncover the ground, you don't know how.\n\nThe rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, hi, there,\nHans, why do you go on foot, then.\n\nI must, answered he, for I have this lump to carry home, it is true\nthat it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it\nhurts my shoulder.\n\nI will tell you what, said the rider, we will exchange, I will give\nyou my horse, and you can give me your lump. With all my heart, said\nHans, but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it.\n\nThe rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up, then gave him\nthe bridle tight in his hands and said, if you want to go at a really\ngood pace, you must click your tongue and call out, jup.  Jup.\n\nHans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so\nbold and free.  After a little while he thought that it ought to go\nfaster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, jup.\nJup.  The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew\nwhere he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated\nthe field from the highway.  The horse would have gone off too if it\nhad not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road\nand driving a cow before him.\n\nHans pulled himself together and stood up on his legs again, but he\nwas vexed, and said to the countryman, it is a poor joke, this\nriding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks\nand throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one's neck.\nNever again will I mount it.  Now I like your cow, for one can walk\nquietly behind her, and have, over and above, one's milk, butter and\ncheese every day without fail.  What would I not give to have such a\ncow.  Well, said the countryman, if it would give you so much\npleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.  Hans agreed\nwith the greatest delight, the countryman jumped upon the horse, and\nrode quickly away.\n\nHans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky\nbargain.  If only I have a morsel of bread - and that can hardly fail\nme - I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like, if I am\nthirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk.  My goodness, what\nmore can I want.\n\nWhen he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great concern ate\nup what he had with him - his dinner and supper - and all he had, and\nwith his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove\nhis cow onwards along the road to his mother's village.\n\nAs it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans\nfound himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross.  He\nfelt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with\nthirst.  I can find a cure for this, thought Hans, I will milk the\ncow now and refresh myself with the milk. He tied her to a withered\ntree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath, but\ntry as he would, not a drop of milk came.  And as he set himself to\nwork in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a\nblow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and\nfor a long time could not think where he was.\n\nBy good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a\nwheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig.  What sort of a trick is\nthis, cried he, and helped the good Hans up.  Hans told him what had\nhappened.  The butcher gave him his flask and said, take a drink and\nrefresh yourself.  The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old\nbeast, at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher.\nWell, well, said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, who\nwould have thought it.  Certainly it is a fine thing when one can\nkill a beast like that at home, what meat one has.  But I do not care\nmuch for beef, it is not juicy enough for me.  A young pig like that\nnow is the thing to have, it tastes quite different, and then there\nare the sausages.\n\nListen, Hans, said the butcher, out of love for you I will exchange,\nand will let you have the pig for the cow.  Heaven repay you for your\nkindness, said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound\nfrom the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his\nhand.\n\nHans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as\nhe wished, if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set\nright.  Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine\nwhite goose under his arm.  They said good morning to each other, and\nHans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such\ngood bargains.  The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a\nchristening-feast.  Just lift her, added he, and laid hold of her by\nthe wings, how heavy she is - she has been fattened up for the last\neight weeks.  Whosoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will\nhave to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth.  Yes, said Hans,\nas he weighed her in one hand, she is a good weight, but my pig is no\nbad one.\n\nMeanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and\nshook his head.  Look here, he said at length, it may not be all\nright with your pig.  In the village through which I passed, the\nmayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty.  I fear - I\nfear that you have got hold of it there.  They have sent out some\npeople and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the\npig, at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole.\n\nThe good Hans was terrified.  Goodness, he said, help me out of this\nfix, you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave\nme your goose.  I shall risk something at that game, answered the\nlad, but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble.  So he\ntook the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a\nby-path.\n\nThe good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under\nhis arm.  When I think over it properly, said he to himself, I have\neven gained by the exchange.  First there is the good roast meat,\nthen the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give\nme dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the\nbeautiful white feathers.  I will have my pillow stuffed with them,\nand then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking.  How glad my\nmother will be.\n\nAs he was going through the last village, there stood a\nscissors-grinder with his barrow, as his wheel whirred he sang,\n     I sharpen scissors and quickly grind,\n     my coat blows out in the wind behind.\n\nHans stood still and looked at him, at last he spoke to him and said,\nall's well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding. Yes,\nanswered the scissors-grinder, the trade has a golden foundation.  A\nreal grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his\npocket finds gold in it.  But where did you buy that fine goose?\n\nI did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it.\n\nAnd the pig?\n\nThat I got for a cow.\n\nAnd the cow?\n\nI took that instead of a horse.\n\nAnd the horse?\n\nFor that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head.\n\nAnd the gold?\n\nWell, that was my wages for seven years, service.\n\nYou have known how to look after yourself each time, said the\ngrinder.  If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle\nin your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your\nfortune.\n\nHow shall I manage that, said Hans.  You must be a grinder, as I am,\nnothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds\nitself.  I have one here, it is certainly a little worn, but you need\nnot give me anything for it but your goose, will you do it?\n\nHow can you ask, answered Hans.  I shall be the luckiest fellow on\nearth.  If I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, why\nshould I ever worry again.  And he handed him the goose and received\nthe grindstone in exchange.  Now, said the grinder, as he took up an\nordinary heavy stone that lay by him, here is a strong stone for you\ninto the bargain, you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your\nold nails.  Take it with you and keep it carefully. Hans loaded\nhimself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart, his eyes\nshining with joy.  I must have been born with a caul, he cried,\neverything I want happens to me just as if I were a sunday-child.\n\nMeanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to\nfeel tired.  Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain\nby which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at\nonce.  At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced\nto stop every minute, the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully.\nThen he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to\ncarry them just then.\n\nHe crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that\nhe would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but\nin order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid\nthem carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down\non it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed\nagainst the stones, and both of them fell into the water.  When Hans\nsaw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy,\nand then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for\nhaving shown him this favor also, and delivered him in so good a way,\nand without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy\nstones which had been the only things that troubled him.\n\nThere is no man under the sun so fortunate as I, he cried out. With a\nlight heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was\nwith his mother at home.\n"
