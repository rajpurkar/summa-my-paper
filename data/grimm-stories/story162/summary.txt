A man sells his oxen. To formulate his price, he takes the butcher a peck of seeds. For each seed in the peck the man will receive one taler. The man drops one seed from his peck on the way to the butcher's shop. As he returns home, the man notices the seed has grown into a tree that reached to heaven. The man climbs the tree to see what the angels are doing. The tree begins to sway because someone is cutting it down. The man grabs a hoe and a flail and makes himself a rope to lower himself down. He lands in a deep hole and uses the flail to get out. He keeps the flail as proof his story is true.
