S"A wife and the parson plan to spend a day together. The wife pretends to be sick and the parson preaches that any man who has a sick relative can cure that person by making a pilgrimage to Gockerli hill. The woman's husband begins his trip. The parson and the wife enjoy each other's company. An eggseller meets the husband on his trip and warns the husband that he has been tricked. The eggseller takes the husband back to the husband's house in his egg basket so that the husband can see for himself what mischief his wife is up to. Once the husband sees what is happening, he chases the parson out of his home. "

S"Once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife, and the parson\nof the village had a fancy for the wife, and had wished for\na long while to spend a whole day happily with her.  The\npeasant woman, too, was quite willing.  One day, therefore, he\nsaid to the woman, listen, my dear friend, I have now thought of\na way by which we can for once spend a whole day happily together.\nI'll tell you what.  On wednesday, you must take to your bed, and\ntell your husband you are ill, and as long as you complain and\nact being ill properly, and go on doing so until sunday when I\nhave to preach, I will then say in my sermon that whosoever has\nat home a sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father,\na sick mother, a sick brother or whosoever else it may be,\nand makes a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where\nyou can get a peck of laurel-leaves for a kreuzer, the sick child,\nthe sick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, or sick mother,\nthe sick sister, or whosoever else it may be, will be restored\nto health immediately.\nI will manage it, said the woman promptly.  On the wednesday,\ntherefore, the peasant woman took to her bed, and complained and\nlamented as agreed on, and her husband did everything for\nher that he could think of, but nothing did her any good, and when\nsunday came the woman said, I feel as ill as if I were going to\ndie at once, but there is one thing I should like to do before\nmy end - I should like to hear the parson's sermon that he is\ngoing to preach to-day.  On that the peasant said, ah, my child,\ndo not do it - you might make yourself worse if you were to get\nup.  Look, I will hear the sermon, and will attend to it very\ncarefully, and will tell you everything the parson says.\nWell, said the woman, go, then, and pay great attention, and\nrepeat to me all that you hear.  So the peasant heard the sermon,\nand the parson said, if any one had at home a sick child, a sick\nhusband, a sick wife, a sick father a sick mother, a sick sister,\nbrother or any one else, and would make a pilgimage to the\ngockerli hill in italy, where a peck of laurel-leaves costs a\nkreuzer, the sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father,\nsick mother, sick sister, brother, or whosoever else it might\nbe, would be restored to health instantly, and whosoever wished\nto undertake the journey was to go to him after the service was\nover, and he would give him the sack for the laurel-leaves and\nthe kreuzer.  Then no one was more rejoiced than the peasant,\nand after the service was over, he went at once to the parson,\nwho gave him the bag for the laurel-leaves and the kreuzer.\nAfter that he went home, and even at the house door he cried,\nhurrah.  Dear wife, it is now almost the same thing as if you were\nwell.  The parson has preached to-day that whosoever had at home\na sick child, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick\nmother, a sick sister, brother or whoever it might be, and would\nmake a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy, where a peck\nof laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, sick husband,\nsick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or\nwhosoever else it was, would be cured immediately, and now I\nhave already got the bag and the kreuzer from the parson, and\nwill at once begin my journey so that you may get well the faster,\nand thereupon he went away.  He was hardly gone however before\nthe woman got up, and the parson was there immediately.\nBut now we will leave these two for a while, and follow the\npeasant, who walked on quickly without stopping, in order to\nget the sooner to the gockerli hill, and on his way he met his\ngossip.  His gossip was an egg-merchant, and was just coming\nfrom the market, where he had sold his eggs.  May you be blessed,\nsaid the gossip, where are you off to so fast.\nTo all eternity, my friend, said the peasant, my wife is ill,\nand I have been to-day to hear the parson's sermon, and he\npreached that if any one had in his house a sick child, a sick\nhusband, a sick\nwife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother or any\none else, and made a pilgrimage to the gockerli hill in italy,\nwhere a peck of laurel-leaves costs a kreuzer, the sick child, the\nsick husband, the sick wife, the sick father, the sick mother,\nthe sick sister, brother or whosoever else it was, would be\ncured immediately, and so I have got the bag for the laurel-leaves\nand the kreuzer from the parson, and now I am beginning my\npilgrimage.  But listen, gossip, said the egg-merchant to the\npeasant, are you, then, stupid enough to believe such a thing\nas that.  Don't you know what it means.  The parson wants to\nspend a whole day alone with your wife in peace, so he has given\nyou this job to do to get you out of the way.\nMy word, said the peasant.  How I'd like to know if that's true.\nCome, then, said the gossip, I'll tell you what to do.  Get\ninto my egg-basket and I will carry you home, and then you will\nsee for yourself.  So that was settled, and the gossip put the\npeasant into his egg-basket and carried him home.\nWhen they got to the house, hurrah.  Everything was already\nvery merry there.  The woman had already had nearly everything\nkilled that was in the farmyard, and had made pancakes, and the\nparson was there, and had brought his fiddle with him.  The\ngossip knocked at the door, and woman asked who was there.  It\nis I, gossip, said the egg-merchant, give me shelter this night.\nI have not sold my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry\nthem home again, and they are so heavy that I shall never be able\nto do it, for it is dark already.\nIndeed, my friend, said the woman, you come at a very inconvenient\ntime for me, but as you are here it can't be helped.  Come in,\nand take a seat there on the bench by the stove.  Then she\nplaced the gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on\nthe bench by the stove.  The parson and the woman, however, were\nas merry as could be.  At length the parson said, listen, my\ndear friend, you can sing beautifully.  Sing something to me.\nOh, said the woman,\nI cannot sing now.  In my young days indeed I could sing well\nenough, but that's all over now.\nCome, said the parson once more, do sing some little song.\nOn that the woman began and sang,\n          I've sent my husband away from me\n          to the gockerli hill in italy.\nThereupon the parson sang,\n          I wish 'twas a year before he came back,\n          I'd never ask him for the laurel-leaf sack.\n          Hallelujah.\nThen the gossip who was in the background began to sing -\nbut I ought to tell you the peasant was called hildebrand -\nso the gossip sang,\n          what are you doing, my hildebrand dear,\n          there on the bench by the stove so near.\n          Hallelujah.\nAnd then the peasant sang from his basket,\n          all singing I ever shall hate from this day,\n          and here in this basket no longer I'll stay.\n          Hallelujah.\nAnd he climbed out of the basket, and flogged the parson\nout of the house.\n"
