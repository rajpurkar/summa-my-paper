A wife and the parson plan to spend a day together. The wife pretends to be sick and the parson preaches that any man who has a sick relative can cure that person by making a pilgrimage to Gockerli hill. The woman's husband begins his trip. The parson and the wife enjoy each other's company. An eggseller meets the husband on his trip and warns the husband that he has been tricked. The eggseller takes the husband back to the husband's house in his egg basket so that the husband can see for himself what mischief his wife is up to. Once the husband sees what is happening, he chases the parson out of his home.
