S'A man goes six times to visit his suitor. Each time he brings her nothing, but rather demands a gift from her. The man either loses or destroys each gift. His mother instructs Hans how he should have treated the gift, and Hans tries to follow her advice. After misunderstanding his mother\'s advice to "cast friendly eyes" on Gretel, Gretel runs away and will have nothing more to do with Hans. '
