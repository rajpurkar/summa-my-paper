S"There were once two brothers who both served as soldiers, one of\nthem was rich, and the other poor.  Then the poor one, to escape\nfrom his poverty, doffed his soldier's coat, and turned farmer.\nHe dug and hoed his bit of land, and sowed it with turnip-seed.\nThe seed came up, and one turnip grew there which became large and\nstrong, and visibly grew bigger and bigger, and seemed as if it\nwould never stop growing, so that it might have been called the\nprincess of turnips, for never was such an one seen before, and\nnever will such an one be seen again.\nAt length it was so enormous that by itself it filled a whole\ncart, and two oxen were required to draw it, and the farmer had\nnot the least idea what he was to do with the turnip, or whether\nit would be a fortune to him or a misfortune.  At last he thought,\nif you sell it, what will you get for it that is of any importance,\nand if you eat it yourself, why, the small turnips would do you\njust as much good.  It would be better to take it to the king, and\nmake him a present of it.\nSo he placed it on a cart, harnessed two oxen, took it to the\npalace, and presented it to the king.  What strange thing is\nthis, said the king.  Many wonderful things have come before my\neyes, but never such a monster as this.  From what seed can this\nhave sprung, or are you a favorite of good fortune and have met\nwith it by chance.  Ah, no, said the farmer, no favorite\nam I.  I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer\nsupport himself hung his soldier's coat on a nail and took to\nfarming land.  I have a brother who is rich and well known to you,\nlord king, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by everyone.\nThen the king felt compassion for him, and said, you shall be\nraised from your poverty, and shall have such gifts from me that\nyou shall be equal to your rich brother.  Then he bestowed\non him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him\nimmensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could\nnot be compared with his.  When the rich brother heard what the\npoor one had gained for himself with one single turnip, he\nenvied him, and thought in every way how he also could come by a\nsimilar piece of luck.  He set about it in a much more cunning\nway, however, and took gold and horses and carried them to the\nking, and made certain the king would give him a much larger\npresent in return.  If his brother had got so much for one\nturnip, what would he not carry away with him in return for such\nbeautiful things as these.  The king accepted his present, and\nsaid he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and\nexcellent than the great turnip.  So the rich man was obliged to\nput his brother's turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home.\nThere, he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until\nbad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother.\nHe hired murderers, who were to lie in ambush, and then he went\nto his brother and said, dear brother, I know of a hidden\ntreasure, we will dig it up together, and divide it between us.\nThe other agreed to this, and accompanied him without suspicion.\nWhile they were on their way the murderers fell on him, bound\nhim, and would have hanged him to a tree.  But just as they were\ndoing this, loud singing and the sound of a horse's feet were\nheard in the distance.  On this their hearts were filled with\nterror, and they pushed their prisoner hastily into the sack, hung\nit on a branch, and took to flight.  He, however, worked up there\nuntil he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his\nhead.  The man who was coming by was no other than a traveling\nstudent, a young fellow who rode on his way through the wood\njoyously singing his song.  When he who was aloft saw that someone\nwas passing below him, he cried, good day.  You have come at\na lucky moment.  The student looked round on every side, but did\nnot know whence the voice came.  At last he said, who calls\nme.  Then an answer came from the top of the tree, raise your\neyes, here I sit aloft in the sack of wisdom.  In a short time\nhave I learnt great things, compared with this all schools are\na jest, in a very short time I shall have learnt everything, and\nshall descend wiser than all other men.  I understand the stars,\nand the tracks of the winds, the sand of the sea, the healing of\nillness, and the virtues of all herbs, birds and stones.  If\nyou were once within it you would feel what noble things issue\nforth from the sack of knowledge.\nThe student, when he heard all this, was astonished, and said,\nblessed be the hour in which I have found you.  May not I also\nenter the sack for a while.  He who was above replied as if\nunwillingly, for a short time I will let you get into it, if\nyou reward me and give me good words, but you must wait an hour\nlonger, for one thing remains which I must learn before I do it.\nWhen the student had waited a while he became impatient, and begged\nto be allowed to get in at once, his thirst for knowledge was\nso very great.  So he who was above pretended\nat last to yield, and said, in order that I may come forth from\nthe house of knowledge you must let it down by the rope, and\nthen you shall enter it.  So the student let the sack down,\nuntied it, and set him free, and then cried, now draw me up at\nonce, and was about to get into the sack.  Halt, said the other,\nthat won't do, and took him by the head and put him upside down\ninto the sack, fastened it, and drew the disciple of wisdom up\nthe tree by the rope.  Then he swung him in the air and said, how\ngoes it with you, my dear fellow.  Behold, already you feel wisdom\ncoming, and you are gaining valuable experience.  Keep perfectly\nquiet until you become wiser.  Thereupon he mounted the student's\nhorse and rode away, but in an hour's time sent someone to let\nthe student out again.\n"
