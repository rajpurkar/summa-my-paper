S"Little brother took his little sister by the hand and said, since\nour mother died we have had no happiness.  Our step-mother\nbeats us every day, and if we come near her she kicks us away\nwith her foot.  Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left\nover.  And the little dog under the table is better off, for she\noften throws it a choice morsel.  God pity us, if our mother only\nknew.  Come, we will go forth together into the wide world.\n\nThey walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony\nplaces.  And when it rained the little sister said, heaven and our\nhearts are weeping together.  In the evening they came to a large\nforest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the\nlong walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.\nThe next day when they awoke, the sun was already high in the\nsky, and shone down hot into the tree.  Then the brother said,\nsister, I am thirsty.  If I knew of a little brook I would go and\njust take a drink.  I think I hear one running.  The brother got up\nand took the little sister by the hand, and they set off to find\nthe brook.  But the wicked step-mother was a witch, and had seen how\nthe two children had gone away, and had crept after them secretly,\nas witches creep, and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest.\n\nNow when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the\nstones, the brother was going to drink out of it, but the sister\nheard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a tiger.\nWho drinks of me will be a tiger.  Then the sister cried, pray,\ndear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and\ntear me to pieces.  The brother did not drink, although he was so\nthirsty, but said, I will wait for the next spring.\n\nWhen they came to the next brook the sister heard this also say,\nwho drinks of me will be a wolf.  Who drinks of me will be a wolf.\nThen the sister cried out, pray, dear brother, do not drink,\nor you will become a wolf, and devour me.  The brother did not\ndrink, and said, I will wait until we come to the next spring, but\nthen I must drink, say what you like.  For my thirst is too great.\nAnd when they came to the third brook the sister heard how it\nsaid as it ran, who drinks of me will be a roebuck.  Who drinks\nof me will be a roebuck.  The sister said, oh, I pray you, dear\nbrother, do not drink, or you will become a roebuck, and run away\nfrom me.  But the brother had knelt down at once by the brook,\nand had bent down and drunk some of the water, and as soon as\nthe first drops touched his lips he lay there in the form of a\nyoung roebuck.\n\nAnd now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother, and\nthe little roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her.  But at\nlast the girl said, be quiet, dear little roe, I will never,\nnever leave you.\n\nThen she untied her golden garter and put it round the roebuck's\nneck, and she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord.  This\nshe tied to the little animal and led it on, and she walked deeper\nand deeper into the forest.\n\nAnd when they had gone a very long way they came at last to a\nlittle house, and the girl looked in.  And as it was empty, she\nthought, we can stay here and live.  Then she sought for leaves\nand moss to make a soft bed for the roe.  And every morning she\nwent out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and\nbrought tender grass for the roe, who ate out of her hand, and was\ncontent and played round about her.  In the evening, when the sister\nwas tired, and had said her prayer, she laid her head upon the\nroebuck's back - that was her pillow, and she slept softly on it.\nAnd if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a\ndelightful life.\nFor some time they were alone like this in the wilderness.  But\nit happened that the king of the country held a great hunt in the\nforest.  Then the blasts of the horns, the barking of dogs and the\nmerry shouts of the huntsmen rang through the trees, and the roebuck\nheard all, and was only too anxious to be there.  Oh, said he,\nto his sister, let me be off to the hunt, I cannot bear it any\nlonger, and he begged so much that at last she agreed.  But, said\nshe to him, come back to me in the evening.  I must shut my door for\nfear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, my little sister,\nlet me in, that I may know you.  And if you do not say that, I\nshall not open the door.  Then the young roebuck sprang away.  So\nhappy was he and so merry in the open air.\nThe king and the huntsmen saw the lovely animal, and started\nafter him, but they could not catch him, and when they thought\nthat they surely had him, away he sprang through the bushes and\nvanished.  When it was dark he ran to the cottage, knocked, and\nsaid, my little sister, let me in.  Then the door was opened for\nhim, and he jumped in, and rested himself the whole night through\nupon his soft bed.\nThe next day the hunt began again, and when the roebuck once\nmore heard the bugle-horn, and the ho. Ho. Of the huntsmen, he\nhad no peace, but said, sister, let me out, I must be off.  His\nsister opened the door for him, and said, but you must be here again\nin the evening and say your pass-word.\nWhen the king and his huntsmen again saw the young roebuck\nwith the golden collar, they all chased him, but he was too quick\nand nimble for them.  This lasted the whole day, but by the evening\nthe huntsmen had surrounded him, and one of them wounded him\na little in the foot, so that he limped and ran slowly.  Then a\nhunter crept after him to the cottage and heard how he said, my\nlittle sister, let me in, and saw that the door was opened for him,\nand was shut again at once.  The huntsman took notice of it all, and\nwent to the king and told him what he had seen and heard.  Then\nthe king said, to-morrow we will hunt once more.\nThe little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she\nsaw that her fawn was hurt.  She washed the blood off him, laid\nherbs on the wound, and said, go to your bed, dear roe, that you\nmay get well again.  But the wound was so slight that the roebuck,\nnext morning, did not feel it any more.  And when he again heard\nthe sport outside, he said, I cannot bear it, I must be there.\nThey shall not find it so easy to catch me.  The sister cried, and\nsaid, this time they will kill you, and here am I alone in the\nforest and forsaken by all the world.  I will not let you out.  Then\nyou will have me die of grief, answered the roe.  When I hear the\nbugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.  Then the\nsister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for him with a\nheavy heart, and the roebuck, full of health and joy, bounded into\nthe forest.\nWhen the king saw him, he said to his huntsmen, now chase\nhim all day long till night-fall, but take care that no one does him\nany harm.\nAs soon as the sun had set, the king said to the huntsman, now\ncome and show me the cottage in the wood.  And when he was at\nthe door, he knocked and called out, dear little sister, let me in.\nThen the door opened, and the king walked in, and there stood\na maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen.  The maiden was\nfrightened when she saw, not her little roe, but a man come in who\nwore a golden crown upon his head.  But the king looked kindly\nat her, stretched out his hand, and said, will you go with me to\nmy palace and be my dear wife.  Yes, indeed, answered the\nmaiden, but the little roe must go with me, I cannot leave him.\nThe king said, it shall stay with you as long as you live, and\nshall want nothing.  Just then he came running in, and the sister\nagain tied him with the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and\nwent away with the king from the cottage.\nThe king took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried\nher to his palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp.\nShe was now the queen, and they lived for a long time happily\ntogether.  The roebuck was tended and cherished, and ran about in\nthe palace-garden.\n But the wicked step-mother, because of whom the children had\ngone out into the world, had never thought but that the sister had\nbeen torn to pieces by the wild beasts in the wood, and that the\nbrother had been shot for a roebuck by the huntsmen.  Now when\nshe heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and\njealousy rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of\nnothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune.  Her own\ndaughter, who was ugly as night, and had only one eye, reproached\nher and said, a queen.  That ought to have been my luck.  Just be\nquiet, answered the old woman, and comforted her by saying,\nwhen the time comes I shall be ready.\nAs time went on the queen had a pretty little boy, and it\nhappened that the king was out hunting.  So the old witch took the\nform of the chamber maid, went into the room where the queen\nlay, and said to her, come the bath is ready.  It will do you good,\nand give you fresh strength.  Make haste before it gets cold.\nHer daughter also was close by.  So they carried the weakly\nqueen into the bath-room, and put her into the bath.  Then they\nshut the door and ran away.  But in the bath-room they had made\na fire of such hellish heat that the beautiful young queen was soon\nsuffocated.\nWhen this was done the old woman took her daughter, put a\nnightcap on her head, and laid her in bed in place of the queen.\nShe gave her too the shape and look of the queen, only she\ncould not make good the lost eye.  But in order that the king might\nnot see it, she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye.\nIn the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son\nhe was heartily glad, and was going to the bed of his dear wife to\nsee how she was.  But the old woman quickly called out, for your\nlife leave the curtains closed.  The queen ought not to see the\nlight yet, and must have rest.  The king went away, and did not find\nout that a false queen was lying in the bed.\nBut at midnight, when all slept, the nurse, who was sitting in the\nnursery by the cradle, and who was the only person awake, saw\nthe door open and the true queen walk in.  She took the child out\nof the cradle, laid it on her arm, and suckled it.  Then she shook\nup its pillow, laid the child down again, and covered it with the\nlittle quilt.  And she did not forget the roebuck, but went into the\ncorner where it lay, and stroked its back.  Then she went quite\nsilently out of the door again.  The next morning the nurse asked\nthe guards whether anyone had come into the palace during the night,\nbut they answered, no, we have seen no one.\nShe came thus many nights and never spoke a word.  The nurse\nalways saw her, but she did not dare to tell anyone about it.\nWhen some time had passed in this manner, the queen began to\nspeak in the night, and said,\n     how fares my child, how fares my roe.\n     Twice shall I come, then never more.\nThe nurse did not answer, but when the queen had gone again,\nwent to the king and told him all.   The king said, ah, God.\nWhat is this.  To-morrow night I will watch by the child.  In the\nevening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the queen again\nappeared and said,\n     how fares my child, how fares my roe.\n     Once will I come, then never more.\nAnd she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she\ndisappeared.  The king dared not speak to her, but on the next\nnight he watched again.  Then she said,\n     how fares my child, how fares my roe.\n     This time I come, then never more.\nThen the king could not restrain himself.  He sprang towards her,\nand said, you can be none other than my dear wife.  She answered,\nyes, I am your dear wife, and at the same moment she received\nlife again, and by God's grace became fresh, rosy and full of\nhealth.\nThen she told the king the evil deed which the wicked witch\nand her daughter had been guilty of towards her.  The king ordered\nboth to be led before the judge, and the judgment was delivered\nagainst them.  The daughter was taken into the forest where she was\ntorn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire\nand miserably burnt.  And as soon as she was burnt to ashes, the\nroebuck changed his shape, and received his human form again, so the\nsister and brother lived happily together all their lives.\n"
