S"There was once upon a time a miller, who had a beautiful\ndaughter, and as she was grown up, he wished that she was\nprovided for, and well married.  He thought, if any good suitor\ncomes and asks for her, I will give her to him.  Not long\nafterwards, a suitor came, who appeared to be very rich, and as\nthe miller had no fault to find with him, he promised his\ndaughter to him.  The maiden, however, did not like him quite\nso much as a girl should like the man to whom she is engaged, and\nhad no confidence in him.  Whenever she saw, or thought of him,\nshe felt a secret horror.  Once he said to her, you are my\nbetrothed, and yet you have never once paid me a visit. The\nmaiden replied, I know not where your house is. Then said the\nbridegroom, my house is out there in the dark forest.  She\ntried to excuse herself\nand said she could not find the way there.  The bridegroom said,\nnext sunday you must come out there to me, I have already\ninvited the guests, and I will strew ashes in order that you may\nfind your way through the forest.  When sunday came, and the\nmaiden had to set out on her way, she became very uneasy, she\nherself knew not exactly why, and to mark her way she filled both\nher pockets full of peas and lentils.  Ashes were strewn at the\nentrance of the forest, and these she followed, but at every step\nshe threw a couple of peas on the ground.  She walked almost the\nwhole day until she reached the middle of the forest, where it\nwas the darkest, and there stood a solitary house, which she did\nnot like, for it looked so dark and dismal.  She went inside it,\nbut no one was within, and the most absolute stillness reigned.\n\nSuddenly a voice cried,\n\tturn back, turn back, young maiden dear,\n\t'tis a murderer's house you enter here.\nThe maiden looked up, and saw that the voice came from a bird,\nwhich was hanging in a cage on the wall.  Again  it cried,\n\tturn back, turn back, young maiden dear,\n\t'tis a murderer's house you enter here.\n\nThen the young maiden went on farther from one room to another,\nand walked through the whole house, but it was entirely empty\nand not one human being was to be found.  At last she came to the\nthe cellar, and there sat an extremely aged woman, whose head\nshook constantly.  Can you not tell me, said the maiden, if my\nbetrothed lives here.\n\nAlas, poor child, replied the old woman, whither have you come.\nYou are in a murderer's den.  You think you are a bride soon to be\nmarried, but you will keep your wedding with death.  Look, I\nhave been forced to put a great kettle on there, with water in it,\nand when they have you in their power, they will cut you to\npieces without mercy, will cook you, and eat you, for they are\neaters of human flesh.  If I do not have compassion on you, and\nsave you, you are lost.\n\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a great hogshead\nwhere she could not be seen.  Be still as a mouse, said she, do\nnot make a sound, or move, or all will be over with you.  At\nnight, when the robbers are asleep, we will escape, I have long\nwaited for an opportunity.  Hardly was this done, than the godless\ncrew came home.  They dragged with them another young girl.  They\nwere drunk, and paid no heed to her screams and lamentations.\n\nThey gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one glass of\nwhite wine, one glass of red, and a glass of yellow, and with\nthis her heart burst in twain.  Thereupon they tore off her\ndelicate raiment, laid her on a table, cut her beautiful body\nin pieces and strewed salt thereon.  The poor bride behind the\ncask trembled and shook, for she saw right well what fate the\nrobbers had destined for her.  One of them noticed a gold ring on\nthe finger of the murdered girl, and as it would not come off at\nonce, he took an axe and cut the finger off, but it sprang up in\nthe air, away over the cask and fell straight into the bride's\nbosom.  The robber took a candle and wanted to look for it, but\ncould not find it.  Then another of them said, have you\nlooked behind the great hogshead.  But the old woman cried,\ncome and get something to eat, and leave off looking till the\nmorning, the finger won't run away from you.\n\nThen the robbers said, the old woman is right, and gave up their\nsearch, and sat down to eat, and the old woman poured a\nsleeping-draught in their wine, so that they soon lay down\nin the cellar, and slept and snored.  When the bride heard\nthat, she came out from behind the hogshead, and had to step\nover the sleepers, for they lay in rows on the ground, and great\nwas her terror lest she should waken one of them.  But God\nhelped her, and she got safely over.  The old woman went up with\nher, opened the doors, and they hurried out of the murderer's den\nwith all the speed in their power.  The wind had blown away the\nstrewn ashes, but the peas and lentils had sprouted and grown up,\nand showed them the way in the moonlight. They walked the whole\nnight, until in the morning they arrived at the mill, and then the\nmaiden told her father everything exactly as it had happened.\n\nWhen the day came for the wedding to be celebrated, the bridegroom\nappeared, and the miller had invited all his relations and\nfriends.  As they sat at table, each was bidden to relate\nsomething.  The bride sat still, and said nothing.  Then said the\nbridegroom to the bride, come, my darling, do you know nothing.\nRelate something to us like the rest.  She replied, then I will\nrelate a dream.  I was walking alone through a wood, and at last\nI came to a house, in which no living soul was, but on the wall\nthere was a bird in a cage which cried,\n\tturn back, turn back, young maiden dear,\n\t'tis a murderer's house you enter here.\nAnd this it cried once more.  My darling, I only dreamt this.\n\nThen I went through all the rooms, and they were all empty, and\nthere was something so horrible about them.  At last I went down\ninto the cellar, and there sat a very very old woman, whose head\nshook.  I asked her, does my bridegroom live in this house.  She\nanswered, alas poor child, you have got into a murderer's den,\nyour bridegroom does live here, but he will hew you in pieces,\nand kill you, and then he will cook you, and eat you.  My darling\nI only dreamt this.  But the old woman hid me behind a great\nhogshead, and scarcely was I hidden, when the robbers came home,\ndragging a maiden with them, to whom they gave three kinds of\nwine to drink, white, red, and yellow, with which her heart broke\nin twain.  My darling, I only dreamt this.  Thereupon they pulled\noff her pretty clothes, and hewed her fair body in pieces on a\ntable, and sprinkled them with salt.  My darling, I only dreamt\nthis.  And one of the robbers saw that there was still a ring on\nher little finger, and as it was hard to draw off, he took an axe\nand cut it off, but the finger sprang up in the air, and sprang\nbehind the great hogshead, and fell in my bosom.  And there is the\nfinger with the ring.  And with these words she drew it forth, and\nshowed it to those present.\n\nThe robber, who had during this story become as pale as ashes,\nleapt up and wanted to escape, but the guests held him fast, and\ndelivered him over to justice.  Then he and his whole troop were\nexecuted for their infamous deeds.\n"
