S"There was once upon a time a man who was about to set out on a long\njourney, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should\nbring back with him for them.  Whereupon the eldest wished for\npearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said, dear\nfather, I should like a singing, soaring lark.  The father said, yes,\nif I can get it, you shall have it, kissed all three, and set out.\n\nNow when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he\nhad brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought\neverywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and\nhe was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child.  Then\nhis road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid\ncastle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the\ntree, he saw a singing, soaring lark.  Aha, you come just at the\nright moment, he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to\nclimb up and catch the little creature.\n\nBut as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook\nhimself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled.  He who\ntries to steal my singing, soaring lark, he cried, will I devour.\nThen the man said, I did not know that the bird belonged to you.  I\nwill make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a\nlarge sum of money, only spare my life.  The lion said, nothing can\nsave you, unless you will promise to give me for my own what first\nmeets you on your return home, and if you will do that, I will grant\nyou your life, and you shall have the bird for your daughter, into\nthe bargain.  But the man hesitated and said, that might be my\nyoungest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on\nmy return home.\n\nThe servant, however, was terrified and said, why should your\ndaughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or\ndog. Then the man allowed himself to be persuaded, took the singing,\nsoaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first\nmeet him on his return home.\n\nWhen he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was\nno other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up,\nkissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with\nhim a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy.  The\nfather, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said, my\ndearest child, I have bought the little bird dear.  In return for it,\nI have been obliged to promise you to a savage lion, and when he has\nyou he will tear you in pieces and devour you, and he told her all,\njust as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what\nmight.\n\nBut she consoled him and said, dearest father, indeed your promise\nmust be fulfilled.  I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I\nmay return to you safely.  Next morning she had the road pointed out\nto her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest.  The\nlion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all\nhis people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their\nnatural human shapes.\n\nOn her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle.  When\nnight came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding\nwas celebrated with great magnificence.  They lived happily together,\nremained awake at night, and slept in the daytime.  One day he came\nand said, to-morrow there is a feast in your father's house, because\nyour eldest sister is to be married, and if you are inclined to go\nthere, my lions shall conduct you.  She said, yes, I should very much\nlike to see my father again, and went thither, accompanied by the\nlions.\n\nThere was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that\nshe had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live.\nBut she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off\nshe was, remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then\nwent back again to the forest.\n\nWhen the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again\ninvited to the wedding, she said to the lion, this time I will not be\nalone, you must come with me.  The lion, however, said that it was\ntoo dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle\nfell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years\nlong would have to fly about with the doves.  She said, ah, but do\ncome with me, I will take great care of you, and guard you from all\nlight.  So they went away together, and took with them their little\nchild as well.\n\nShe had a room built there, so strong and thick that no ray could\npierce through it, in this he was to shut himself up when the candles\nwere lit for the wedding-feast.  But the door was made of green wood\nwhich warped and left a little crack which no one noticed.  The\nwedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession\nwith all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by\nthis apartment, a ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant,\nand when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a\nwhite dove was sitting there.  The dove said to her, for seven years\nmust I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I\nwill let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will\nshow you the way, and if you follow the trace you can release me.\nThereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and at\nevery seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather\nfell down and showed her the way.\n\nSo she went continually further and further in the wide world, never\nlooking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past,\nthen she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be saved, and yet\nthey were so far from it.  Once when they were thus moving onwards,\nno little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised\nher eyes the dove had disappeared.  And as she thought to herself, in\nthis no man can help you, she climbed up to the sun, and said to him,\nyou shine into every crevice, and over every peak, have you not seen\na white dove flying.\n\nNo, said the sun, I have seen none, but I present you with a casket,\nopen it when you are in sorest need.  Then she thanked the sun, and\nwent on until evening came and the moon appeared, she then asked her,\nyou shine the whole night through, and on every field and forest,\nhave you not seen a white dove flying.\n\nNo, said the moon, I have seen no dove, but here I give you an egg,\nbreak it when you are in great need.  She thanked the moon, and went\non until the night wind came up and blew on her, then she said to it,\nyou blow over every tree and under every leaf, have you not seen a\nwhite dove flying.  No, said the night wind, I have seen none, but I\nwill ask the three other winds, perhaps they have seen it.\n\nThe east wind and the west wind came, and had seen nothing, but the\nsouth wind said, I have seen the white dove, it has flown to the red\nsea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven years are over,\nand the lion is there fighting with a dragon, the dragon, however, is\nan enchanted princess.  The night wind then said to her, I will\nadvise you, go to the red sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds,\ncount them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon with it,\nthen the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will regain\ntheir human form.  After that, look round and you will see the\ngriffin which is by the red sea, swing yourself, with your beloved,\non to his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own\nhome.  Here is a nut for you, when you are above the center of the\nsea, let the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall\nnut-tree will grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest,\nfor if he cannot rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you\nacross, and if you forget to throw down the nut, he will let you fall\ninto the sea.\n\nThen she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had\nsaid.  She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh,\nstruck the dragon therewith, whereupon the lion conquered it, and\nimmediately both of them regained their human shapes.  But when the\nprincess, who hitherto had been the dragon, was released from\nenchantment, she took the youth by the arm, seated herself on the\ngriffin, and carried him off with her.\n\nThere stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again\nforsaken.  She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and\nsaid, still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the\ncock crows, until I find him, and she went forth by long, long roads,\nuntil at last she came to the castle where both of them were living\ntogether, there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which\nthey would celebrate their wedding, but she said, God still helps me,\nand opened the casket that the sun had given her.  A dress lay\ntherein as brilliant as the sun itself.  So she took it out and put\nit on, and went up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride\nherself, looked at her with astonishment.\n\nThe dress pleased the bride so well that she thought it might do for\nher wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale.  Not for money or\nland, answered she, but for flesh and blood.  The bride asked her\nwhat she meant by that, so she said, let me sleep a night in the\nchamber where the bridegroom sleeps.  The bride would not, yet wanted\nvery much to have the dress, at last she consented, but the page was\nto give the prince a sleeping-draught.\n\nWhen it was night, therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she\nwas led into the chamber, she seated herself on the bed and said, I\nhave followed after you for seven years.  I have been to the sun and\nthe moon, and the four winds, and have enquired for you, and have\nhelped you against the dragon, will you, then quite forget me.  But\nthe prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind\nwere whistling outside in the fir-trees.\n\nWhen therefore day broke, she was led out again, and had to give up\nthe golden dress.  And as that even had been of no avail, she was\nsad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept.  While she was\nsitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her,\nshe opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens\nall of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the\nold hen's wings, nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world.\nThen she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until\nthe bride looked out of the window.\n\nThe little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came\ndown and asked if they were for sale.  Not for money or land, but for\nflesh and blood, let me sleep another night in the chamber where the\nbridegroom sleeps.  The bride said, yes, intending to cheat her as on\nthe former evening.  But when the prince went to bed he asked the\npage what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been.  On this\nthe page told all, that he had been forced to give him a\nsleeping-draught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in the\nchamber, and that he was to give him another that night.  The prince\nsaid, pour out the draught by the bed-side.\n\nAt night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill\nall had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by\nher voice, sprang up and cried, now I really am released.  I have\nbeen as it were in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me\nso that I have been compelled to forget you, but God has delivered me\nfrom the spell at the right time.\n\nThen they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared\nthe father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated\nthemselves on the griffin which bore them across the red sea, and\nwhen they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut.  Immediately\na tall nut-tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried\nthem home, where they found their child, who had grown tall and\nbeautiful, and they lived thenceforth happily until their death.\n"
