S'Between werrel and soist there lived a man whose name was knoist,\nand he had three sons.  One was blind, the other lame, and the\nthird stark-naked.  Once on a time they went into a field,\nand there they saw a hare.  The blind one shot it, the lame one\ncaught it, the naked one put it in his pocket.  Then they came to\na mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed,\none sank, the third had no bottom to it.  They all three got\ninto the one with no bottom to it.  Then they came to a mighty\nbig forest in which there was a mighty big tree, in the tree\nwas a mighty big chapel - in the chapel was a sexton made of\nbeech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy water with\ncudgels.\n               How truly happy is that one\n               who can from holy water run.\n'
