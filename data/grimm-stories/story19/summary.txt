A peasant is working in his field when he sees a devil sitting on a heap of burning coals. The devil is sitting on a treasure that the peasant may have if gives the devil one-half of everything his garden produces for two years. This first year the devil wants his half to contain everything that grows above the ground, while the peasant will keep what grows below the ground. The peasant agrees and plants turnips that year. Seeing that he has been outsmarted, the devil asks for everything that grows below the ground the next year, so the peasant grows wheat. The devil is cheated and goes away angry.
