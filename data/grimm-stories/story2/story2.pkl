S"There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\nbestow on her a son or a daughter.  Then an angel from heaven came to\nher and said, be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of\nwishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he\nhave.  Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings,\nand when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was\nfilled with gladness.\n\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream.  It\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\nher arms and she fell asleep.  Then came the old cook, who knew that\nthe child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a\nhen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the\nqueen's apron and on her dress.  Then he carried the child away to a\nsecret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to\nthe king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be\ntaken from her by the wild beasts.  When the king saw the blood on\nher apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered\na high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be\nseen, and had his wife put into it, and walled up.  Here she was to\nstay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger.  But\nGod sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which\nflew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years\nwere over.\n\nThe cook, however, thought to himself, if the child has the power of\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.  So\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\nspeak, and said to him, wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.  Scarcely were the words\nout of the boy's mouth, when everything was there that he had wished\nfor.  After a while the cook said to him, it is not well for you to\nbe so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.  Then the king's\nson wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was\nmore beautiful than any painter could have painted her.\n\nThe two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts,\nand the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman.  The thought\noccurred to him, however, that the king's son might some day wish to\nbe with his father, and thus bring him into great peril.  So he went\nout and took the maiden aside, and said, to-night when the boy is\nasleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring\nme his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your\nlife.\n\nThereupon he went away, and when he returned next day she had not\ndone it, and said, why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who\nhas never harmed anyone.  The cook once more said, if you do not do\nit, it shall cost you your own life.\n\nWhen he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and\nordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid\nthem on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the\nboy, lie down in your bed, and draw the clothes over you.  Then the\nwicked wretch came in and said, where are the boy's heart and tongue.\nThe girl reached the plate to him, but the king's son threw off the\nquilt, and said, you old sinner, why did you want to kill me.  Now\nwill I pronounce thy sentence.  You shall become a black poodle and\nhave a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till\nthe flames burst forth from your throat.  And when he had spoken\nthese words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a\ngold collar round his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up\nsome live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from\nhis throat.\n\nThe king's son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of\nhis mother, and wondered if she were still alive.  At length he said\nto the maiden, I will go home to my own country, if you will go with\nme, I will provide for you.\n\nAh, she replied, the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange\nland where I am unknown.  As she did not seem quite willing, and as\nthey could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be\nchanged into a beautiful pink, and took her with him.  Then he went\naway to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him.\n\nHe went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was\nso high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top.\nThen he mounted up and looked inside, and cried, beloved mother, lady\nqueen, are you still alive, or are you dead.  She answered, I have\njust eaten, and am still satisfied, for she thought the angels were\nthere.  Said he, I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said\nto have torn from your arms, but I am alive still, and will soon set\nyou free.\n\nThen he descended again, and went to his father, and caused himself\nto be ammounced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer\nhim service.  The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game\nfor him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up\ntheir quarters in any part of the district or country.  Then the\nhuntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could\npossibly use at the royal table.  So he summoned all the huntsmen\ntogether, and bade them go out into the forest with him.  And he went\nwith them and made them form a great circle, open at one end where he\nstationed himself, and began to wish.\n\nTwo hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once, and\nthe huntsmen shot them.  Then they were all placed on sixty country\ncarts, and driven home to the king, and for once he was able to deck\nhis table with game, after having had none at all for years.\n\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsmen, as you are\nso clever, you shall sit by me.  He replied, lord king, your majesty\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.  But the king insisted on it,\nand said, you shall sit by me, until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\nthere, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\nking's principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask\nhow it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive\nstill, or had perished.\n\nHardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said, your\nmajesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen living in the\ntower.  Is she still alive, or has she died?  But the king replied,\nshe let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts, I will not have\nher named.  Then the huntsman arose and said, gracious lord father,\nshe is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by\nwild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\narms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\nchicken.\n\nThereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said, that is\nthe wretch, and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog\nwas compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\nforth from its throat.  On this the huntsman asked the king if he\nwould like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into\nthe form of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his\nwhite apron, and his knife by his side.  When the king saw him he\nfell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest\ndungeon.\n\nThen the huntsman spoke further and said, father, will you see the\nmaiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder\nme, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it.  The king\nreplied, yes, I would like to see her.  The son said, most gracious\nfather, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower, and\nhe thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and\nplaced it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king\nhad never seen one to equal it.  Then the son said, now will I show\nher to you in her own form, and wished that she might become a\nmaiden, and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter\ncould have made her look more so.\n\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the\ntower, to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when\nwhe was led in she ate nothing, and said, the gracious and merciful\nGod who has supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.  She\nlived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was\nburied, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower,\nand were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on\nher grave.  The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces,\nbut grief consumed the king's own heart, and he soon died.  His son\nmarried the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower\nin his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to\nGod.\n"
