S'There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey\ntogether.  So the cock built a beautiful carriage, which had four\nred wheels, and harnessed four mice to it.  The hen seated herself\nin it with the cock, and they drove away together.  Not long\nafterwards they met a cat who said, where are you going.  The\ncock replied, we are going to the house of herr korbes.  Take me\nwith you, said the cat.  The cock answered, most willingly, get\nup behind, lest you fall off in front.\nTake great care not to dirty my little red wheels.  And you little\nwheels, roll on, and you little mice pipe out, as we go forth on\nour way to the house of herr korbes.\nAfter this came a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin,\nand at last a needle, who all seated themselves in the carriage,\nand drove with them.  When they reached the house of herr korbes,\nhowever, herr korbes was not there.  The mice drew the carriage\ninto the barn, the hen flew with the cock upon a perch.  The cat\nsat down by the hearth, the duck on the well-pole.  The egg rolled\nitself into a towel, the pin stuck itself into the chair-cushion,\nthe needle jumped on to the bed in the middle of the pillow, and\nthe millstone laid itself over the door.  Then herr korbes came\nhome, went to the hearth, and was about to light the fire, when\nthe cat threw a quantity of ashes in his face.  He ran into the\nkitchen in a great hurry to wash it off, and the duck splashed some\nwater in his face.  He wanted to dry it with the towel, but the\negg rolled up against him, broke, and glued up his eyes.  He\nwanted to rest, and sat down in the chair, and then the pin\npricked him.  He fell in a passion, and threw himself on his bed,\nbut as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, the needle pricked\nhim, so that he screamed aloud, and was just going to run out\ninto the wide world in his rage, but when he came to the\nhouse-door, the millstone fell down and struck him dead.  Herr\nkorbes must have been a very wicked man.\n'
