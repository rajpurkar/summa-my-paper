S"Two kings' sons once went out in search of adventures, and fell into\na wild, disorderly way of living, so that they never came home again.\nThe youngest, who was called simpleton, set out to seek his brothers,\nbut when at length he found them they mocked him for thinking that he\nwith his simplicity could get through the world, when they two could\nnot make their way, and yet were so much cleverer.\n\nThey all three traveled away together, and came to an ant-hill.  The\ntwo elder wanted to destroy it, to see the little ants creeping about\nin their terror, and carrying their eggs away, but simpleton said,\nleave the creatures in peace, I will not allow you to disturb them.\n\nThen they went onwards and came to a lake, on which a great number of\nducks were swimming.  The two brothers wanted to catch a couple and\nroast them, but simpleton would not permit it, and said, leave the\ncreatures in peace, I will not suffer you to kill them.\n\nAt length they came to a bee's nest, in which there was so much honey\nthat it ran out of the trunk of the tree where it was.  The two\nwanted to make a fire beneath the tree, and suffocate the bees in\norder to take away the honey, but simpleton again stopped them and\nsaid, leave the creatures in peace, I will not allow you to burn\nthem.\n\nAt length the three brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses\nwere standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen, and\nthey went through all the halls until, quite at the end, they came to\na door in which were three locks.  In the middle of the door,\nhowever, there was a little pane, through which they could see into\nthe room.  There they saw a little grey man, who was sitting at a\ntable.  They called him, once, twice, but he did not hear, at last\nthey called him for the third time, when he got up, opened the locks,\nand came out.  He said nothing, however, but conducted them to a\nhandsomely-spread table, and when they had eaten and drunk, he took\neach of them to a bedroom.\n\nNext morning the little grey man came to the eldest, beckoned to him,\nand conducted him to a stone table, on which were inscribed three\ntasks, by the performance of which the castle could be delivered from\nenchantment.\n\nThe first was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the\nprincess's pearls, a thousand in number, which must be picked up, and\nif by sunset one single pearl was missing, he who had looked for them\nwould be turned into stone.  The eldest went thither, and sought the\nwhole day, but when it came to an end, he had only found one hundred,\nand what was written on the table came true, and he was turned into\nstone. Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure, but it\ndid not fare much better with him than with the eldest, he did not\nfind more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone.  At last\nit was simpleton's turn to seek in the moss, but it was so difficult\nfor him to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated\nhimself on a stone, and wept.  And while he was thus sitting, the\nking of the ants whose life he had once saved, came with five\nthousand ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the\npearls together, and laid them in a heap.\n\nThe second task, however, was to fetch out of the lake the key of the\nking's daughter's bed-chamber.  When simpleton came to the lake, the\nducks which he had saved, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the\nkey out of the water.\n\nBut the third task was the most difficult, from amongst the three\nsleeping daughters of the king was the youngest and dearest to be\nsought out.  They, however, resembled each other exactly, and were\nonly to be distinguished by their having eaten different sweetmeats\nbefore they fell asleep, the eldest a bit of sugar, the second a\nlittle syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey.\n\nThen the queen of the bees, whom simpleton had protected from the\nfire, came and tasted the lips of all three, and at last she remained\nsitting on the mouth which had eaten honey, and thus the king's son\nrecognized the right princess.  Then the enchantment was at an end,\neverything was delivered from sleep, and those who had been turned to\nstone received once more their natural forms.\n\nSimpleton married the youngest and sweetest princess, and after her\nfather's death became king, and his two brothers received the two\nother sisters.\n"
