The youngest of a king's three sons is made fun of when he tries to join his elder brothers and make his way in the world. As the boys travel through the world, they come on a group of ants whom the youngest son will not let the older ones injure. They also encounter some ducks and bees, which the youngest protects as well. The group comes to a castle where everything is asleep or has been turned to stone. They finally find a man who tells them the secret of breaking the curse that lies over the castle. The older brothers cannot break the curse, but the youngest does with the help of the animals. At the completion of this final task, the spell is broken and the Simpleton marries the youngest princess and becomes king.
