S"There were once a man and a woman who had an only child, and\nlived quite alone in a solitary valley.  It came to pass that the\nmother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir, and\ntook with her little Hans, who was just two years old.  As it\nwas spring-time, and the child took pleasure in the many-colored\nflowers, she went still further onwards with him into the forest.\nSuddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket, seized the mother\nand child, and carried them far away into the black forest, where\nno one ever came from one year's end to another.  The poor woman\nurgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free, but\ntheir hearts were made of stone, they would not listen to her\nprayers and entreaties, and drove her on farther by force.  After\nthey had worked their way through bushes and briars for about\ntwo miles, they came to a rock where there was a door, at which\nthe robbers knocked and it opened at once.  They had to go through\na long dark passage, which burnt on the hearth.  On the wall hung\nswords, sabres, and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the\nlight, and in the midst stood a black table at which four other\nrobbers were sitting gambling, and the captain sat at the head of\nit.  As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her, and\ntold her to be at ease and have no fear, they would do nothing to\nhurt her, but she must look after the housekeeping, and if she\nkept everything in order, she should not fare ill with them.\nThereupon they gave her something to eat, and showed her a bed\nwhere she might sleep with her child.\nThe woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew\ntall and strong.  His mother told him stories, and taught him\nto read an old book of tales about knights which she found in\nthe cave.  When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong\nclub out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then\nwent to his mother and said, dear mother, pray tell me who is\nmy father.  I must and will know.  His mother was silent and\nwould not tell him, that he might not become home-sick.  Moreover\nshe knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but\nit almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father.\nIn the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing\nexpedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain,\nand said, I now wish to know who my father is, and if you do not\ntell me at once I will strike you down.  Then the captain laughed,\nand gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table.\nHans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, I will wait\nanother year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then.\nWhen the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the\ndust off it, looked at it well, and said,\nit is a stout strong club.  At night the robbers came home,\ndrank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be\nheavy.  Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before\nthe captain, and asked him who his father was.  But the captain\nagain gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled\nunder the table.  However, it was not long before he was up again,\nand so beat the captain and the robbers with his club, that\nthey could no longer move either their arms or their legs.\nHis mother stood in a corner full of admiration for his bravery\nand strength.  When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother,\nand said, now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I\nmust also know who my father is.  Dear Hans, answered the\nmother, come, we will go and seek him until we find him.  She\ntook from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans\nfetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and\nwhatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was\nfull, and then he took it on his back.  They left the cave, but\nhow Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness\ninto daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and\nthe birds, and the morning sun in the sky.  He stood there and\nwondered at everything just as if he were not quite right in the\nhead.  His mother looked for the way home, and when they had\nwalked for a couple of hours, they got safely into their lonely\nvalley and to their little house.  The father was sitting in the\ndoorway.  He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard\nthat Hans was his son, for he had long regarded them both as\ndead.  But Hans, although he was not twelve years old, was a\nhead taller than his father.  They went into the little room\ntogether, but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by\nthe stove, than the whole house began to crack - the bench broke\ndown and then the floor, and the heavy sack fell through into\nthe cellar.  God save us, cried the father, what's that.  Now\nyou have broken our little house to pieces.  Don't let that turn\nyour hair grey, dear father, answered Hans.  There, in that sack,\nis more than is wanting for a new house.  The father and Hans\nat once began to build a new house, to buy cattle and land, and\nto keep a farm.  Hans ploughed the fields, and\nwhen he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground, the\nbullocks had scarcely any need to draw.\nThe next spring, Hans said, keep all the money and have made for\nme a walking-stick that weighs a hundred-weight, that I may\ngo a-traveling.  When the stick was ready, he left his father's\nhouse, went forth, and came to a deep, dark forest.  There he\nheard something crunching and cracking, looked round, and saw\na fir-tree which was wound round like a rope from the bottom to\nthe top, and when he looked upwards he saw a great fellow who\nhad laid hold of the tree and was twisting it like a willow-wand.\nHullo, cried Hans, what are you doing up there.  The fellow\nreplied, I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting\na rope for them.  That is what I like, thought Hans, he has some\nstrength, and he called to him, leave that alone, and come with\nme.  The fellow came down, and he was taller by a whole head than\nHans, and Hans was not little.  Your name is now fir-twister,\nsaid Hans to him.  Thereupon they went further and heard something\nknocking and hammering with such force that the ground shook\nat every stroke.  Shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock,\nbefore which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of\nit away with his fist.  When Hans asked what he was doing, he\nanswered, at night, when I want to sleep, bears, wolves, and\nother vermin of that kind come, which sniff and snuffle about\nme and won't let me rest, so I want to build myself a house and\nlay myself inside it, so that I may have some peace.  Oh indeed,\nthought Hans, I can make use of this one also, and said to him,\nleave your house-building alone, and go with me.  You shall be\ncalled rock-splitter.  The man consented, and they all three\nroamed through the forest, and wherever they went the wild beasts\nwere terrified, and ran away from them.  In the evening they\ncame to an old deserted castle, went up into it, and\nlaid themselves down in the hall to sleep.  The next morning Hans\nwent into the garden.  It had run quite wild, and was full of\nthorns and brambles.  And as he was thus walking round about,\na wild boar rushed at him, he, however, gave it such a blow\nwith his club that it fell directly.  He took it on his shoulders\nand carried it\nin, and they put it on a spit, roasted it, and enjoyed themselves.\nThen they arranged that each day, in turn, two should go out\nhunting, and one should stay at home, and cook nine pounds\nof meat for each of them.  Fir-twister stayed at home the first,\nand Hans and rock-splitter went out hunting.  When fir-twister\nwas busy cooking, a little shrivelled-up old mannikin came to him\nin the castle, and asked for some meat.  Be off, you sneaking\nimp, he answered, you need no meat.  But how astonished fir-twister\nwas when the little insignificant dwarf sprang up at him, and\nbelabored him so with his fists that he could not defend himself,\nbut fell on the ground and gasped for breath.  The dwarf did\nnot go away until he had thoroughly vented his anger on him.\nWhen the two others came home from hunting, fir-twister said\nnothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows which he\nhimself had received, and thought, when they stay at home, they\nmay just try their  chance with the little scrubbing-brush, and\nthe mere thought of that gave him pleasure already.\nThe next day rock-splitter stayed at home, and he fared just\nas fir-twister had done, being very ill-treated by the dwarf\nbecause he was not willing to give him any meat.  When the others\ncame home in the evening, fir-twister saw clearly what he had\nsuffered, but both kept silence, and thought, Hans also\nmust taste some of that soup.\nHans, who had to stay at home the next day, did his work in\nthe kitchen as it had to be done, and as he was standing\nskimming the pan, the dwarf came and without more ado\ndemanded a piece of meat.  Then Hans thought, he is a poor\nwretch, I will give him some of my share, that the others may\nnot run short, and handed him a bit.  When the dwarf had\ndevoured it, he again asked for some meat, and good-natured\nHans gave it to him, and told him it was a handsome piece,\nand that he was to be content with it.  But the dwarf begged\nagain for the third time.  You are shameless, said Hans, and gave\nhim none.  Then the malicious dwarf wanted to spring on him and\ntreat him as he had treated fir-twister and rock-splitter, but\nhe had chosen the wrong man.  Hans, without\nexerting himself much, gave him a couple of blows which made\nhim jump down the castle steps.  Hans was about to run after him,\nbut fell right over, flat on his face.  When he rose up again,\nthe dwarf had got the start of him.  Hans hurried after him as far\nas the forest, and saw him slip into a hole in the rock.  Hans now\nwent home, but he had marked the spot.  When the two others\ncame back, they were surprised that Hans was so well.  He told\nthem what had happened, and then they no longer concealed how\nit had fared with them.  Hans laughed and said, it served you\nquite right.  Why were you so mean with your meat.  It is a\ndisgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be\nbeaten by the dwarf.  Thereupon they took a basket and a rope,\nand all three went to the hole in the rock into which the\ndwarf had slipped, and let Hans and his club\ndown in the basket.  When Hans had reached the bottom, he found\na door, and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there\nwho was lovely as any picture, nay, so beautiful that no words\ncan express it, and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at\nHans like a sea-cat.  She, however, was bound with chains, and\nlooked so mournfully at him that Hans felt great pity for her,\nand thought to himself, you must deliver her out of the power of\nthe wicked dwarf, and gave him such a blow with his club that he\nfell down dead.  Immediately the chains fell from\nthe maiden, and Hans was enraptured with her beauty.  She told\nhim she was a king's daughter whom a savage count had stolen\naway from her home, and imprisoned there among the rocks,\nbecause she would have nothing to say to him.  The count, however,\nhad set the dwarf as a watchman, and he had made her suffer\nmisery and vexation enough.  And now Hans placed the maiden in the\nbasket and had her drawn up.  The basket came down again, but\nHans did not trust his two companions, and thought, they have\nalready shown themselves to be false, and told me nothing about\nthe dwarf.  Who knows what design they may have against me.  So\nhe put his club in the basket, and it was lucky he did, for when\nthe basket was half-way up, they let it fall again, and if Hans\nhad really been sitting in it he would have been killed.  But\nnow he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths,\nand when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no\ncounsel.  It is indeed sad, said he to himself, that I have to\nwaste away down here, and as he was thus walking backwards and\nforwards, he once more came to the little chamber where the maiden\nhad been sitting, and saw that the dwarf had a ring on his finger\nwhich shone and sparkled.  Then he drew it off and put it on, and\nwhen he turned it round on his finger, he suddenly heard something\nrustle over his head.  He looked up and saw spirits of the air\nhovering above, who told him he was their master, and asked\nwhat his desire might be.  Hans was at first struck dumb, but\nafterwards he said that they were to carry him up again.  They\nobeyed instantly, and it was just as if he had flown up himself.\nBut when he had arrived there, he found no one in sight.\nFir-twister and rock-splitter\nhad hurried away, and had taken the beautiful maiden with them.\nBut Hans turned the ring, and the spirits of the air came and\ntold him that the two were on the sea.  Hans ran and ran without\nstopping, until he came to the sea-shore, and there far, far out\non the water, he perceived a little boat in which his faithless\ncomrades were sitting, and in fierce anger he leapt, without\nthinking what he was doing, club in hand into the water, and\nbegan to swim, but the club, which weighed a hundredweight,\ndragged him deep down until he was all but drowned.  Then\nin the very nick of time he turned his ring, and immediately\nthe spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as lightning into\nthe boat.  He swung his club and gave his wicked comrades the\nreward they merited and threw them into the water, and then he\nsailed with the beautiful maiden, who had been in the greatest\nalarm, and whom he delivered for the second time, home to her\nfather and mother, and married her, and all rejoiced exceedingly.\n"
