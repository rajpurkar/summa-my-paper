S'A king gives his sons a test to determine which one will rule his kingdom once he has passed away. He asks the boys to go out and bring back the most beautiful carpet they can find. In order to make things fair, the king blows three feathers into the air, each determines which direction each of the three boys will take. Of the two elder boys one goes east while another goes west. The feather of the youngest goes straight up and back down. The youngest son notices a trap door in the ground. After he goes through this door, he meets a toad who gives him a beautiful carpet. The older brothers bring back rough handkerchiefs. When the king declares the youngest will be king, the elder sons begs for another test. Just as before, the youngest goes down the trap...'

S"There was once upon a time a king who had three sons, of whom two\nwere clever and wise, but the third did not speak much, and was\nsimple, and was called the simpleton.  When the king had become old\nand weak, and was thinking of his end, he did not know which of his\nsons should inherit the kingdom after him.  Then he said to them, go\nforth, and he who brings me the most beautiful carpet shall be king\nafter my death.\n\nAnd that there should be no dispute amongst them, he took them\noutside his castle, blew three feathers in the air, and said, you\nshall go as they fly.  One feather flew to the east, the other to the\nwest, but the third flew straight up and did not fly far, but soon\nfell to the ground.\n\nAnd now one brother went to the right, and the other to the left, and\nthey mocked simpleton, who was forced to stay where the third feather\nhad fallen.  He sat down and was sad.  Then all at once he saw that\nthere was a trap-door close by the feather.  He raised it up, found\nsome steps, and went down them.  Then he came to another door,\nknocked at it, and heard somebody inside calling -\n          little green waiting-maid,\n          waiting-maid with the limping leg,\n          little dog of the limping leg,\n          hop hither and thither,\n          and quickly see who is without.\n\nThe door opened, and he saw a great, fat toad sitting, and round\nabout her a crowd of little toads.  The fat toad asked what he\nwanted.  He answered, I should like to have the prettiest and finest\ncarpet in the world.  Then she called a young one and said -\n          little green waiting-maid,\n          waiting-maid with the limping leg,\n          little dog of the limping leg,\n          hop hither and thither,\n          and bring me the great box.\n\nThe young toad brought the box, and the fat toad opened it, and gave\nsimpleton a carpet out of it, so beautiful and so fine, that on the\nearth above, none could have been woven like it.  Then he thanked\nher, and climbed out again.\n\nThe two others, however, had looked on their youngest brother as so\nstupid that they believed he would find and bring nothing at all.\nWhy should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble searching, said\nthey, and got some coarse handkerchiefs from the first shepherds'\nwives whom they met, and carried them home to the king.\n\nAt the same time simpleton also came back, and brought his beautiful\ncarpet, and when the king saw it he was astonished, and said, if\njustice be done, the kingdom belongs to the youngest.  But the two\nothers let their father have no peace, and said that it was\nimpossible that simpleton, who in everything lacked understanding,\nshould be king, and entreated him to make a new agreement with them.\nThen the father said, he who brings me the most beautiful ring shall\ninherit the kingdom, and led the three brothers out, and blew into\nthe air three feathers, which they were to follow.  Those of the two\neldest again went east and west, and simpleton's feather flew\nstraight up, and fell down near the door into the earth.\n\nThen he went down again to the fat toad, and told her that he wanted\nthe most beautiful ring.  She at once ordered her big box to be\nbrought, and gave him a ring out of it, which sparkled with jewels,\nand was so beautiful that no goldsmith on earth would have been able\nto make it.\n\nThe two eldest laughed at simpleton for going to seek a golden ring.\nThey gave themselves no trouble, but knocked the nails out of an old\ncarriage-ring, and took it to the king, but when simpleton produced\nhis golden ring, his father again said, the kingdom belongs to him.\nThe two eldest did not cease from tormenting the king until he made a\nthird condition, and declared that the one who brought the most\nbeautiful woman home, should have the kingdom.  He again blew the\nthree feathers into the air, and they flew as before.\n\nThen simpleton without more ado went down to the fat toad, and said,\nI am to take home the most beautiful woman.  Oh, answered the toad,\nthe most beautiful woman.  She is not at hand at the moment, but\nstill you shall have her.  She gave him a yellow turnip which had\nbeen hollowed out, to which six mice were harnessed.  Then simpleton\nsaid quite mournfully, what am I to do with that.  The toad answered,\njust put one of my little toads into it.  Then he seized one at\nrandom out of the circle, and put her into the yellow coach, but\nhardly was she seated inside it than she turned into a wonderfully\nbeautiful maiden, and the turnip into a coach, and the six mice into\nhorses.  So he kissed her, and drove off quickly with the horses, and\ntook her to the king.\n\nHis brothers, who came afterwards, had given themselves no trouble at\nall looking for beautiful girls, but had brought with them the first\npeasant women they chanced to meet.  When the king saw them he said,\nafter my death the kingdom belongs to my youngest son.  But the two\neldest deafened the king's ears afresh with their clamor, we cannot\nconsent to simpleton's being king, and demanded that the one whose\nwife could leap through a ring which hung in the centre of the hall\nshould have the preference.  They thought, the peasant women can do\nthat easily, they are strong enough, but the delicate maiden will\njump herself to death.\n\nThe aged king agreed likewise to this.  Then the two peasant women\njumped, and jumped through the ring, but were so clumsy that they\nfell, and their coarse arms and legs broke in two.  And then the\npretty maiden whom simpleton had brought with him, sprang, and sprang\nthrough as lightly as a deer, and all opposition had to cease. So he\nreceived the crown, and has ruled wisely for a length of time.\n"
