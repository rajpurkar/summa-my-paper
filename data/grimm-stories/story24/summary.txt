An old woman sits mourning because she is all alone. The woman is especially sad and angry with God because of the death of her sons. She hears the bells ring, telling her it is time to go the church for prayers. She notices the church is full of her dead relatives. They tell her to look at the altar if she wants to see her sons. One son is hanging from a gallows while the other is bound to a wheel. At once she realizes what extra sorrow she would have had to bear if her sons had actually died this way instead of dying in their youth. The old woman immediately thanks God for His divine care and timing.
