S"A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom\nthrough all the land.  Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed\nas if news of the most secret things was brought to him through\nthe air.  But he had a strange custom, every day after dinner,\nwhen the table was cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty\nservant had to bring him one more dish.  It was covered, however,\nand even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did\nanyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it\nuntil he was quite alone.\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who\ntook away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he\ncould not help carrying the dish into his room.  When he had\ncarefully locked the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white\nsnake lying on the dish.  But when he saw it he could not deny\nhimself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut off a little bit\nand put it into his mouth.  No sooner had it touched his tongue\nthan he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his\nwindow.  He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\nthe sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one\nanother of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields\nand woods.  Eating the snake had given him power of understanding\nthe language of animals.\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this\ntrusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere.  The king\nordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with\nangry words that unless he could before the morrow point out\nthe thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed.\nIn vain he declared his innocence, he was dismissed with no better\nanswer.\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took\nthought how to help himself out of his trouble.  Now\nsome ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking\ntheir rest, and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth\nwith their bills, they were having a confidential conversation\ntogether.  The servant stood by and listened.  They were telling\none another of all the places where they had been waddling\nabout all the morning, and what good food they had found, and one\nsaid in a pitiful tone, something lies heavy on my stomach, as I\nwas eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the\nqueen's window.  The servant at once seized her by the neck,\ncarried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook, here is a fine\nduck, pray, kill her.  Yes, said the cook, and weighed her in\nhis hand, she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has\nbeen waiting to be roasted long enough.  So he cut off her head,\nand as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen's ring was\nfound inside her.\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence, and the king,\nto make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favor, and\npromised him the best place in the court that he could wish for.\nThe servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and\nsome money for traveling, as he had a mind to see the world\nand go about a little.  When his request was granted he\nset out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw\nthree fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water.  Now,\nthough it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting\nthat they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart,\nhe got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the\nwater.  They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried\nto him, we will remember you and repay you for saving us.\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a\nvoice in the sand at his feet.  He listened, and heard an ant-king\ncomplain, why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off\nour bodies.  That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been\ntreading down my people without mercy.  So he turned on to a side\npath and the ant-king cried out to him, we will remember you - one\ngood turn deserves another.\nThe path led him into a wood, and here he saw two old ravens\nstanding by their nest, and throwing out their young ones.\nOut with you, you idle, good-for-nothing creatures, cried\nthey, we cannot find food for you any longer, you are big enough,\nand can provide for yourselves.  But the poor young ravens lay\nupon the ground, flapping their wings, and crying, oh, what\nhelpless chicks we are.  We must shift for ourselves, and yet we\ncannot fly.  What can we do, but lie here and starve.  So the\ngood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword,\nand gave it to them for food.  Then they came hopping up to it,\nsatisfied their hunger, and cried, we will remember you - one good\nturn deserves another.\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a\nlong way, he came to a large city.  There was a great noise and\ncrowd in the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying\naloud, the king's daughter wants a husband, but whoever seeks her\nhand must perform a hard task, and if he does not succeed he\nwill forfeit his life.  Many had already made the attempt, but\nin vain, nevertheless when the youth saw the king's daughter\nhe was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all\ndanger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into\nit, before his eyes, then the king ordered him to fetch this\nring up from the bottom of the sea, and added, if you come up\nagain without it you will be thrown in again and again until you\nperish amid the waves.  All the people grieved for the handsome\nyouth, then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea.\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when\nsuddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they\nwere the very fishes whose lives he had saved.  The one in the\nmiddle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore\nat the youth's feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it,\nthere lay the gold ring in the shell.  Full of joy he took it to\nthe king, and expected that he would grant him the promised reward.\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal\nin birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform\nanother task.  She went down into the garden and strewed with her\nown hands ten sacks-full of millet-seed on the grass, then she\nsaid, tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up,\nand not a single grain be wanting.\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might\nbe possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing,\nand there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he\nshould be led to death.  But as soon as the first rays of the\nsun shone into the garden he saw all the ten sacks standing side\nby side, quite full, and not a single grain was missing.  The\nant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of\nants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked\nup all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\nPresently the king's daughter herself came down into the garden,\nand was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she\nhad given him.  But she could not yet conquer her proud heart,\nand said, although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not\nbe my husband until he has brought me an apple from the tree of\nlife.  The youth did not know where the tree of life stood, but\nhe set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs\nwould carry him, though he had no hope of finding it.  After he\nhad wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a\nwood, and lay down under a tree to sleep.  But he heard a\nrustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand.\nAt the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves\nupon his knee, and said, we are the three young ravens whom\nyou saved from starving, when we had grown big, and heard that\nyou were seeking the golden apple, we flew over the sea to the\nend of the world, where the tree of life stands, and have brought\nyou the apple.  The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and\ntook the golden apple to the king's beautiful daughter, who had\nno more excuses left to make.  They cut the apple of life in two\nand ate it together, and then her heart became full of love for\nhim, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\n"
