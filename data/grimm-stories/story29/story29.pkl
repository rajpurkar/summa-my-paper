S'A poor child and her mother are given a pot that will cook porridge when commanded and stop cooking when commanded. The mother asks the pot to cook porridge and eats until she is satisfied. The mother cannot remember the command to make the pot stop cooking, so it continues to make porridge until the entire town is filled. The child stops the pot from cooking, but not soon enough to spare the town.'

S'There was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her\nmother, and they no longer had anything to eat.  So the child went\ninto the forest, and there an aged woman met her who was aware of her\nsorrow, and presented her with a little pot, which when she said,\ncook, little pot, cook, would cook good, sweet porridge, and when she\nsaid, stop, little pot, it ceased to cook.  The girl took the pot\nhome to her mother, and now they were freed from their poverty and\nhunger, and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose.  Once on a\ntime when the girl had gone out, her mother said, cook, little pot,\ncook.  And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied, and then\nshe wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word.  So it\nwent on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge, and still it\ncooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full, and then the\nnext house, and then the whole street, just as if it wanted to\nsatisfy the hunger of the whole world, and there was the greatest\ndistress, but no one knew how to stop it.  At last when only one\nsingle house remained, the child came home and just said, stop,\nlittle pot, and it stopped and gave up cooking, and whosoever wished\nto return to the town had to eat his way back.\n'
