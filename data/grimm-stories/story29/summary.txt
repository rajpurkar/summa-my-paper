A poor child and her mother are given a pot that will cook porridge when commanded and stop cooking when commanded. The mother asks the pot to cook porridge and eats until she is satisfied. The mother cannot remember the command to make the pot stop cooking, so it continues to make porridge until the entire town is filled. The child stops the pot from cooking, but not soon enough to spare the town.
