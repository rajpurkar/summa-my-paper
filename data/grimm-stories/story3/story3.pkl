S'There was once on a time a poor man, who could no longer\nsupport his only son.  Then said the son, dear father, things go so\nbadly with us that I am a burden to you.  I would\nrather go away and see how I can earn my bread.  So the father gave\nhim his blessing, and with great sorrow took leave of him.  At this\ntime the king of a mighty empire was at war and the youth took\nservice with him, and went out to fight.  And when he came before\nthe enemy, there was a battle, and great danger, and it rained shot\nuntil his comrades fell on all sides, and when the leader also was\nkilled, those left were about to take flight, but the youth stepped\nforth, spoke boldly to them, and cried, we will not let our\nfather-land be ruined.  Then the others followed him, and he pressed\non and conquered the enemy.  When the king heard that he owed the\nvictory to him alone, he raised him above all the others, gave him\ngreat treasures, and made him the first in the kingdom.\n\nThe king had a daughter who was very beautiful, but she was\nalso very strange.  She had made a vow to take no one as her lord\nand husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive\nwith her if she died first.  If he loves me with all his heart, said\nshe, of what use will life be to him afterwards.  On her side she\nwould do the same, and if he died first, would go down to the grave\nwith him.  This strange oath had up to this time frightened away\nall wooers, but the youth became so charmed with her beauty that\nhe cared for nothing, but asked her father for her.  But do you\nknow what you must promise, said the king.  I must be buried\nwith her, he replied, if I outlive her, but my love is so great that\nI do not mind the danger.  Then the king consented, and the wedding\nwas solemnized with great splendor.\n\nThey lived now for a while happy and contented with each other,\nand then it befell that the young queen was attacked by a severe\nillness, and no physician could save her. And as she lay there dead,\nthe young king remembered what he had been obliged to promise, and\nwas horrified at having to lie down alive in the grave, but there\nwas no escape.  The king had placed sentries at all the gates, and\nit was not possible to avoid his fate.  As the day came when the\ncorpse was to be buried, he was taken down with it into the royal\nvault and then the door was shut and bolted.\n\nNear the coffin stood a table on which were four candles, four\nloaves of bread, and four bottles of wine, and when this provision\ncame to an end, he would have to die of hunger.  And now he sat\nthere full of pain and grief, ate every day only a little piece of\nbread, drank only a mouthful of wine, and nevertheless saw death\ndaily drawing nearer.  Whilst he thus gazed before him, he saw a\nsnake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body.\nAnd as he thought it came to gnaw at it, he drew his sword and said,\nas long as I live, you shall not touch her, and hewed the snake in\nthree pieces.  After a time a second snake crept out of the hole,\nand when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces, it went back,\nbut soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth.  Then it\ntook the three pieces of the snake, laid them together, as they\nfitted, and placed one of the leaves on each wound.  Immediately the\nsevered parts joined themselves together, the snake moved, and\nbecame alive again, and both of them hastened away together.  The\nleaves were left lying on the ground, and a desire came into the\nmind of the unhappy man who had been watching all this, to know\nif the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the snake\nto life again, could not likewise be of service to a human being.\n\nSo he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his\ndead wife, and the two others on her eyes.  And hardly had he done\nthis than the blood stirred in her veins, rose into her pale face,\nand colored it again.  Then she drew breath, opened her eyes, and\nsaid, ah, God, where am I.  You are with me, dear wife, he answered,\nand told her how everything had happened, and how he\nhad brought her back again to life.  Then he gave her some wine and\nbread, and when she had regained her strength, he raised her up\nand they went to the door and knocked, and called so loudly that\nthe sentries heard it, and told the king.  The king came down\nhimself and opened the door, and there he found both strong and\nwell, and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over.  The\nyoung king, however, took the three snake-leaves with him, gave\nthem to a servant and said, keep them for me carefully, and carry\nthem constantly about you.  Who knows in what trouble they may yet\nbe of service to us.\n\nBut a change had taken place in his wife.  After she had been\nrestored to life, it seemed as if all love for her husband had gone\nout of her heart.  After some time, when he wanted to make a voyage\nover the sea, to visit his old father, and they had gone on board a\nship, she forgot the great love and fidelity which he had shown\nher, and which had been the means of rescuing her from death,\nand conceived a wicked inclination for the skipper.  And once when\nthe young king lay there asleep, she called in the skipper and\nseized the sleeper by the head, and the skipper took him by the\nfeet, and thus they threw him down into the sea.  When the\nshameful deed was done, she said, now let us return home, and say\nthat he died on the way.  I will extol and praise you so to my\nfather that he will marry me to you, and make you the heir to his\ncrown.  But the faithful servant who had seen all that they did,\nunseen by them, unfastened a little boat from the ship, got into it,\nsailed after his master, and let the traitors go on their way.  He\nfished up the dead body, and by the help of the three snake-leaves\nwhich he carried about with him, and laid on the eyes and mouth,\nhe fortunately brought the young king back to life.\n\nThey both rowed with all their strength day and night, and their\nlittle boat sailed so swiftly that they reached the old king\nbefore the others.  He was astonished when he saw them come alone,\nand asked what had happened to them.  When he learnt the wickedness\nof his daughter he said, I cannot believe that she has behaved so\nill, but the truth will soon come to light, and bade both go into a\nsecret chamber and keep themselves hidden from everyone.  Soon\nafterwards the great ship came sailing in, and the godless woman\nappeared before her father with a troubled countenance.  He said,\nwhy do you come back alone.  Where is your husband.  Ah, dear\nfather, she replied, I come home again in great grief.  During\nthe voyage, my husband became suddenly ill and died, and if the\ngood skipper had not given me his help, it would have gone ill with\nme.  He was present at his death, and can tell you all.  The king\nsaid, I will make the dead alive again, and opened the chamber,\nand bade the two come out.  When the woman saw her husband, she\nwas thunderstruck, and fell on her knees and begged for mercy.\n\nThe king said, there is no mercy.  He was ready to die with you\nand restored you to life again, but you have murdered him in his\nsleep, and shall receive the reward that you deserve.  Then she was\nplaced with her accomplice in a ship which had been pierced with\nholes, and sent out to sea, where they soon sank amid the waves.\n'
