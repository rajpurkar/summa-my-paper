S"There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor.\nThe rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he\ngained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so\nbadly that he had no bread for his wife and children.  Once\nwhen he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on\none side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he\nhad never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with\namazement.\nWhile he was thus standing he saw twelve great, wild men coming\ntowards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his\nbarrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see\nwhat would happen.  The twelve men, however, went to the\nmountain and cried, semsi mountain, semsi mountain, open up, and\nimmediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and\nthe twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it\nshut.  After a short time, it opened again, and the men came\nforth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they\nwere all once more in the daylight they said, semsi mountain,\nsemsi mountain, shut yourself, then the mountain closed\ntogether, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it,\nand the twelve went away.\nWhen they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from\nthe tree, and was curious to know what was secretly hidden in\nthe mountain.  So he went up to it and said, semsi mountain,\nsemsi mountain, open up, and the mountain opened up to him also.\nThen he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of\nsilver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and\nsparkling jewels, heaped up like corn.  The poor man hardly knew\nwhat to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for\nhimself or not.  At last he filled his pockets with gold, but\nhe left the pearls and precious stones where they were.  When he\ncame out again he also said, semsi mountain, semsi mountain,\nshut yourself, and the mountain closed itself, and he went home\nwith his barrow.\nAnd now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread\nfor his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain.\nHe lived joyously and honorably, gave help to the poor, and did\ngood to every one.  When the money came to an end, however, he\nwent to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel,\nand brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the\nmost valuable things.  When for the third time he wanted to\nfetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother.\nBut the rich man had long been envious of his brother's\npossessions, and of the handsome household which he kept up,\nand could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his\nbrother wanted with the measure.  Then he thought of a cunning\ntrick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when\nhe got the measure back a piece of gold was sticking to it.  He\nat once went to his brother and asked him, what have you been\nmeasuring in the bushel measure.  Corn and barley, said the other.\nThen he showed him the piece of gold and threatened that if he did\nnot tell\nthe truth he would accuse him before a court of justice.  The poor\nman then told him everything, just as it had happened.  So the\nrich man ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away,\nresolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had\ndone, and to bring back with him quite different treasures.\nWhen he came to the mountain he cried, semsi mountain, semsi\nmountain, open up.  The mountain opened, and he went inside it.\nThere lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he\ndid not know which to grab first.  At length he loaded himself\nwith as many precious stones as he could carry.  He wished to\ncarry his burden outside, but as his heart and soul were entirely\nfull of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain,\nand cried, simeli mountain, simeli mountain, open up.  That,\nhowever, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred,\nbut remained shut.  Then he was alarmed, and the longer he\nthought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and\nall his treasures were of no help to him.  In the evening the\nmountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they\nsaw him they laughed, and cried out, bird, have we caught you\nat last.  Did you think we had never noticed that you had\nbeen in here twice.  We could not catch you then, this third\ntime you shall not get out again.  Then he cried, it was not I,\nit was my brother, but let him beg for his life and say what he\nwould, they cut off his head.\n"
