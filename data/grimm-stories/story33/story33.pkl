S'Upon the birth of their daughter a king and queen give a feast. They invite only twelve of the thirteen Wise Women in the kingdom. The thirteenth one is left out because they do not have enough plates. As the Wise Women are blessing the child, the thirteenth woman shows up and places a curse upon the child. At the age of fifteen years old the child will prick herself with the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. All the guests are in shock at this curse but the twelfth Wise Woman has not blessed the child yet. She is not able to undo the curse but softens it by saying the child will not die but only sleep for 100 years. The curse comes to pass and the entire castle falls into a deep sleep. The castle is grown over with a thorny hedge...'

S"\tBriar-Rose\n\nA long time ago there were a king and queen who said every\nday, ah, if only we had a child, but they never had one.  But\nit happened that once when the queen was bathing, a frog\ncrept out of the water on to the land, and said to her, your\nwish shall be fulfilled, before a year has gone by, you shall\nhave a daughter.\n\nWhat the frog had said came true, and the queen had a little\ngirl who was so pretty that the king could not contain himself\nfor joy, and ordered a great feast.  He invited not only his\nkindred, friends and acquaintances, but also the wise women, in\norder that they might be kind and well-disposed towards the\nchild.  There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but, as\nhe had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out of, one\nof them had to be left at home.\n\nThe feast was held with all manner of splendor and when it\ncame to an end the wise women bestowed their magic gifts\nupon the baby - one gave virtue, another beauty, a third\nriches, and so on with everything in the world that one can\nwish for.\n\nWhen eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the\nthirteenth came in.  She wished to avenge herself for not\nhaving been invited, and without greeting, or even looking\nat anyone, she cried with a loud voice, the king's daughter\nshall in her fifteenth year prick herself with a spindle, and fall\ndown dead.  And, without saying a word more, she turned round\nand left the room.\n\nThey were all shocked, but the twelfth, whose good wish still\nremained unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo\nthe evil sentence, but only soften it, she said, it shall\nnot be death, but a deep sleep of a hundred years, into which\nthe princess shall fall.\n\nThe king, who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune,\ngave orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should\nbe burnt.  Meanwhile the gifts of the wise women were plenteously\nfulfilled on the young girl, for she was so beautiful, modest,\ngood-natured, and wise, that everyone who saw her was bound\nto love her.\n\nIt happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years\nold, the king and queen were not at home, and the maiden\nwas left in the palace quite alone.  So she went round into\nall sorts of places, looked into rooms and bed-chambers just\nas she liked, and at last came to an old tower.  She climbed\nup the narrow winding-staircase, and reached a little door.\nA rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it the door\nsprang open, and there in a little room sat an old woman with\na spindle, busily spinning her flax.\n\nGood day, old mother, said the king's daughter, what are you\ndoing there.  I am spinning, said the old woman, and nodded\nher head.  What sort of thing is that, that rattles round\nso merrily, said the girl, and she took the spindle and wanted\nto spin too.  But scarcely had she touched the spindle when the\nmagic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it.\n\nAnd, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell\ndown upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.\nAnd this sleep extended over the whole palace, the king and\nqueen who had just come home, and had entered the great hall,\nbegan to go to sleep, and the whole of the court with them.\nThe horses, too, went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in\nthe yard, the pigeons upon the roof, the flies on the wall,\neven the fire that was flaming on the hearth became quiet\nand slept, the roast meat left off frizzling, and the\ncook, who was just going to pull the hair of the scullery boy,\nbecause he had forgotten something, let him go, and went to\nsleep.  And the wind fell, and on the trees before the\ncastle not a leaf moved again.\n\nBut round about the castle there began to grow a hedge of\nthorns, which every year became higher, and at last grew\nclose up round the castle and all over it, so that there\nwas nothing of it to be seen, not even the flag upon the\nroof.  But the story of the beautiful sleeping briar-rose,\nfor so the princess was named, went about the country,\nso that from time to time kings' sons came and tried to\nget through the thorny hedge into the castle.\n\nBut they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast\ntogether, as if they had hands, and the youths were caught\nin them, could not get loose again, and died a miserable\ndeath.\n\nAfter long, long years a king's son came again to that\ncountry, and heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge,\nand that a castle was said to stand behind it in which a\nwonderfully beautiful princess, named briar-rose, had been\nasleep for a hundred years, and that the king and queen and\nthe whole court were asleep likewise.  He had heard, too,\nfrom his grandfather, that many kings, sons had already come,\nand had tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had\nremained sticking fast in it, and had died a pitiful death.\n\nThen the youth said, I am not afraid, I will go and see\nthe beautiful briar-rose.  The good old man might dissuade him\nas he would, he did not listen to his words.\n\nBut by this time the hundred years had just passed, and the\nday had come when briar-rose was to awake again.  When the\nking's son came near to the thorn-hedge, it was nothing but\nlarge and beautiful flowers, which parted from each other of\ntheir own accord, and let him pass unhurt, then they closed\nagain behind him like a hedge.  In the castle yard he saw the\nhorses and the spotted hounds lying asleep, on the roof sat\nthe pigeons with their heads under their wings.  And when he\nentered the house, the flies were asleep upon the wall, the\ncook in the kitchen was still holding out his hand to seize the\nboy, and the maid was sitting by the black hen which she\nwas going to pluck.\n\nHe went on farther, and in the great hall he saw the whole of\nthe court lying asleep, and up by the throne lay the king and\nqueen.\n\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath\ncould be heard, and at last he came to the tower, and opened the\ndoor into the little room where briar-rose was sleeping.\n\nThere she lay, so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away,\nand he stooped down and gave her a kiss.  But as soon as he\nkissed her, briar-rose opened her eyes and awoke, and looked\nat him quite sweetly.\n\nThen they went down together, and the king awoke, and the\nqueen, and the whole court, and looked at each other in\ngreat astonishment.  And the horses in the courtyard stood\nup and shook themselves, the hounds jumped up and wagged their\ntails, the pigeons upon the roof pulled out their heads from\nunder their wings, looked round, and flew into the open\ncountry, the flies on the wall crept again, the fire in the\nkitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat, the joint\nbegan to turn and sizzle again, and the cook gave the boy such\na box on the ear that he screamed, and the maid finished\nplucking the fowl.\n\nAnd then the marriage of the king's son with briar-rose was\ncelebrated with all splendor, and they lived contented to the\nend of their days.\n"
