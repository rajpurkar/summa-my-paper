S"There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she\nwas her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she\nhated, because she was her step-daughter.  The step-daughter once had\na pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became\nenvious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron.\nBe quiet, my child, said the old woman, and you shall have it.  Your\nstep-sister has long deserved death, to-night when she is asleep I\nwill come and cut her head off.  Only be careful that you are at the\nfar-side of the bed, and push her well to the front. It would have\nbeen all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been\nstanding in a corner, and heard everything.\n\nAll day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bed-time had\ncome, the witch's daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\nfar side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\nfront, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall.\nIn the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her\nright hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the\noutside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her\nown child's head off.\n\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart,\nwho was called roland, and knocked at his door.  When he came out,\nshe said to him, listen, dearest roland, we must fly in all haste.\nMy step-mother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child.  When\ndaylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.\nBut, said roland, I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or\nwe cannot escape if she pursues us.  The maiden fetched the magic\nwand, and she took the dead girl's head and dropped three drops of\nblood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and\none on the stairs. Then she hurried away with her lover.\n\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come.  Then the witch\ncried, where are you.  Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping, answered\nthe first drop of blood.  The old woman went out, but saw no one on\nthe stairs, and cried again, where are you.  Here in the kitchen, I\nam warming myself, cried the second drop of blood.  She went into the\nkitchen, but found no one.  Then she cried again, where are you.  Ah,\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping, cried the third drop of blood.  She\nwent into the room to the bed.  What did she see there.  Her own\nchild, whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood.\n\nThe witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could\nlook forth quite far into the world, she perceived her step-daughter\nhurrying away with her sweetheart roland.  That shall not help you,\ncried she, even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not\nescape me.  She put on her many league boots, in which she covered an\nhour's walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook\nthem.  The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding towards\nher, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart roland into a lake,\nand herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it.\n\n The witch placed herself on the shore, threw bread-crumbs in, and\nwent to endless trouble to entice the duck, but the duck did not let\nherself be enticed, and the old woman had to go home at night as she\nhad come.  At this the girl and her sweetheart roland resumed their\nnatural shapes again, and they walked on the whole night until\ndaybreak.  Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower\nwhich stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart roland\ninto a fiddler.  It was not long before the witch came striding up\ntowards them, and said to the musician, dear musician, may I pluck\nthat beautiful flower for myself.\n\nOh, yes, he replied, I will play to you while you do it.  As she was\nhastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the\nflower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play,\nand whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a\nmagical dance.  The faster he played, the more violent springs was\nshe forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body,\nand pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not\nstop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\n\nAs they were now set free, roland said, now I will go to my father\nand arrange for the wedding.  Then in the meantime I will stay here\nand wait for you, said the girl, and that no one may recognize me, I\nwill change myself into a red stone land-mark.\n\nThen roland went away, and the girl stood like a red land-mark in the\nfield and waited for her beloved.  But when roland got home, he fell\ninto the snares of another, who so fascinated him that he forgot the\nmaiden.  The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as\nhe did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a\nflower, and thought, someone will surely come this way, and trample\nme down.\n\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field, and\nsaw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with\nhim, and laid it away in his chest.  From that time forth, strange\nthings happened in the shepherd's house.  When he arose in the\nmorning all the work was already done, the room was swept, the table\nand benches cleaned, the fire on the hearth was lighted, and the\nwater was fetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was\nlaid, and a good dinner served.  He could not conceive how this came\nto pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one\ncould have concealed himself in it.\n\nHe was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last\nhe was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her\nadvice.  The wise woman said, there is some enchantment behind it,\nlisten very early some morning if anything is moving in the room, and\nif you see anything, no matter what it is, throw a white cloth over\nit, and then the magic will be stopped.\n\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day\ndawned, he saw the chest open, and the flower come out.  Swiftly he\nsprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it.  Instantly the\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\ntime she had attended to his housekeeping.  She told him her story,\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\nanswered, no, for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\nroland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not\nto go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\n\nAnd now the time drew near when roland's wedding was to be\ncelebrated, and then, according to an old custom in the country, it\nwas announced that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing\nin honor of the bridal pair.  When the faithful maiden heard of this,\nshe grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would\nnot go thither, but the other girls came and took her.  When it came\nto her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only\none left, and then she could not refuse.\n\nBut when she began her song, and it reached roland's ears, he sprang\nup and cried, I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have\nno other.  Everything he had forgotten, and which had vanished from\nhis mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart.  Then the\nfaithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart roland, and\ngrief came to an end and joy began.\n"
