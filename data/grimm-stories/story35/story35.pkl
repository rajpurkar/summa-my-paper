S"There was once a man whose wife died, and a woman whose husband\ndied, and the man had a daughter, and the woman also had a\ndaughter.  The girls were acquainted with each other, and went\nout walking together, and afterwards came to the woman in her\nhouse.  Then said she to the man's daughter, listen, tell your\nfather that I would like to marry him, and then you shall\nwash yourself in milk every morning, and drink wine, but my own\ndaughter shall wash herself in water and drink water.  The girl\nwent home, and told her father what the woman had said.  The\nman said, what shall I do.  Marriage is a joy and also a torment.\nAt length as he could come to no decision, he pulled off his boot,\nand said, take this boot, it has a hole in the sole of it.  Go with\nit up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into\nit.  If it hold the water, then I will again take a wife, but if it\nrun through, I will not.  The girl did as she was bid, but the water\ndrew the hole together and the boot became full to the top.  She\ninformed her father how it had turned out.  Then he himself went up,\nand when he saw that she was right, he went to the widow and wooed\nher, and the wedding was celebrated.\nThe next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before\nthe man's daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to\ndrink, but before the woman's daughter stood water to wash\nherself with and water for drinking.  On the second morning, stood\nwater for washing and water for drinking before the man's\ndaughter as well as before the woman's daughter.  And on the third\nmorning stood water for washing and water for drinking before the\nman's daughter, and milk for washing and wine for drinking, before\nthe woman's daughter, and so it continued.  The woman became her\nstep-daughter's bitterest enemy, and day by day did her best to\ntreat her still worse.  She was also envious because her\nstep-daughter was beautiful and lovable, and her own daughter ugly\nand repulsive.\nOnce, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone,\nand hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock\nof paper, called her step-daughter, and said, here, put on this\ndress and go out into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of\nstrawberries - I have a fancy for some.  Good heavens, said the\ngirl, no strawberries grow in winter.  The ground is frozen, and\nbesides the snow has covered everything.  And why am I to go in\nthis paper frock.  It is so cold outside that one's very breath\nfreezes.  The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns\ntear it off my body.  Will you contradict me,  said the step-mother.\nSee that you go, and do not show your face again until you have\nthe basketful of strawberries.  Then she gave her a little piece of\nhard bread, and said, this will last you the day, and thought,\nyou will die of cold and hunger outside, and will never be seen\nagain by me.\nThen the maiden was obedient, and put on the paper frock, and\nwent out with the basket.  Far and wide there was nothing but snow,\nand not a green blade to be seen.  When she got into the wood she\nsaw a small house out of which peeped three little men.  She wished\nthem good day, and knocked modestly at the door.  They cried,\ncome in, and she entered the room and seated herself on the bench by\nthe stove, where she began to warm herself and eat her breakfast.\nThe little men said, give us some of it, too.  Willingly,\nshe said, and divided her piece of bread in two 'and gave\nthem the half.  They asked, what do you here in the forest in the\nwinter time, in your thin dress.  Ah, she answered, I am to look\nfor a basketful of strawberries, and am not to go home until I can\ntake them with me.  When she had eaten her bread, they gave her\na broom and said, sweep away the snow at the back door.  But\nwhen she was outside, the three little men said to each other, what\nshall we give her as she is so good, and has shared her bread with\nus.  Then said the first, my gift is, that she shall every day grow\nmore beautiful.  The second said, my gift is, that gold pieces shall\nfall out of her mouth every time she speaks.  The third said, my\ngift is, that a king shall come and take her to wife.\nThe girl, however, did as the little men had bidden\nher, swept away the snow behind the little house with\nthe broom, and what did she find but real ripe strawberries,\nwhich came up quite dark-red out of the snow.  In her\njoy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the\nlittle men, shook hands with each of them, and ran\nhome to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much.\nWhen she went in and said good-evening, a piece of gold at once\nfell out of her mouth.  Thereupon she related what had happened\nto her in the wood, but with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell\nfrom her mouth, until very soon the whole room was covered with\nthem.  Now look at her arrogance, cried the step-sister, to throw\nabout gold in that way.  But she was secretly envious of it, and\nwanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries.  The mother\nsaid, no, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, you might freeze\nto death.  However, as her daughter let her have no peace, the\nmother at last yielded, made her a magnificent coat of fur, which\nshe was obliged to put on, and gave her bread-and-butter and cake\nfor her journey.\nThe girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house.\nThe three little men peeped out again, but she did not greet them,\nand without looking round at them and without speaking to them,\nshe went awkwardly into the room, seated herself by the stove, and\nbegan to eat her bread-and-butter and cake.  Give us some of it,\ncried the little men.  But she replied, there is not enough for\nmyself, so how can I give it away to other people.  When she had\nfinished eating, they said, there is a broom for you, sweep it all\nclean in front of the back-door.  Sweep for yourselves, she\nanswered, I am not your servant.  When she saw that they were\nnot going to give her anything, she went out by the door.  Then the\nlittle men said to each other, what shall we give her as she is so\nnaughty, and has a wicked envious heart, that will never let her do\na good turn to any one.  The first said, I grant that she may grow\nuglier every day.  The second said, I grant that at every word she\nsays, a toad shall spring out of her mouth.  The third said, I grant\nthat she may die a miserable death.  The maiden looked for\nstrawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home.\nAnd when she opened her mouth, and was about to tell her mother what\nhad happened to her in the wood, with every word she said, a toad\nsprang out of her mouth, so that everyone was seized with horror\nof her.\nThen the step-mother was still more enraged, and thought of\nnothing but how to do every possible injury to the man's daughter,\nwhose beauty, however, grew daily greater.  At length she took a\ncauldron, set it on the fire, and boiled yarn in it.  When it was\nboiled, she flung it on the poor girl's shoulder, and gave her an\naxe in order that she might go on the frozen river, cut a hole in\nthe ice, and rinse the yarn.  She was obedient, went thither and cut\na hole in the ice.  And while she was in the midst of her cutting, a\nsplendid carriage came driving up, in which sat the king.  The\ncarriage stopped, and the king asked, my child, who are you, and\nwhat are you doing here.  I am a poor girl, and I am rinsing yarn.\nThen the king felt compassion, and when he saw that she was so very\nbeautiful, he said to her, will you go away with me.  Ah, yes, with\nall my heart, she answered, for she was glad to get away from the\nmother and sister.\nSo she got into the carriage and drove away with the king, and\nwhen they arrived at his palace, the wedding was celebrated with\ngreat pomp, as the little men had granted to the maiden.  When a\nyear was over, the young queen bore a son, and as the step-mother\nhad heard of her great good-fortune, she came with her daughter\nto the palace and pretended that she wanted to pay her a visit.\nBut, when the king had gone out, and no one else was present, the\nwicked woman seized the queen by the head, and her daughter\nseized her by the feet, and they lifted her out of the bed, and\nthrew her out of the window into the stream which flowed by.  Then\nthe ugly daughter laid herself in the bed, and the old woman\ncovered her up over her head.  When the king came home again and\nwanted to speak to his wife, the old woman cried, hush, hush, that\ncan't be now, she is lying in a violent sweat.  You must let her\nrest to-day.  The king suspected no evil, and did not come back\nagain till next morning.  And as he talked with his wife and she\nanswered him, with every word a toad leaped out, whereas formerly a\npiece of gold had fallen.  Then he asked what that could be, but the\nold woman said that she had got that from the violent sweat, and\nwould soon lose it again.  During the night, however, the scullion\nsaw a duck come swimming up the gutter, and it said -\n     king, what art thou doing now.\n     Sleepest thou, or wakest thou.\nAnd as he returned no answer, it said -\n     and my guests, what may they do.\nThe scullion said -\n     they are sleeping soundly, too.\nThen it asked again -\n     what does little baby mine.\nHe answered -\n     sleepeth in her cradle fine.\nThen she went upstairs in the form of the queen, nursed the\nbaby, shook up its little bed, covered it over, and then swam away\nagain down the gutter in the shape of a duck.  She came thus for\ntwo nights.  On the third, she said to the scullion, go and tell the\nking to take his sword and swing it three times over me on the\nthreshold.  Then the scullion ran and told this to the king, who\ncame with his sword and swung it thrice over the spirit, and at the\nthird time, his wife stood before him strong, living, and healthy\nas she had been before.  Thereupon the king was full of great joy,\nbut he kept the queen hidden in a chamber until the sunday, when\nthe baby was to be christened.  And when it was christened he said,\nwhat does a person deserve who drags another out of bed and\nthrows him in the water.  The wretch deserves nothing better,\nanswered the old woman, than to be taken and put in a barrel\nstuck full of nails, and rolled down hill into the water.  Then,\nsaid the king, you have pronounced your own sentence.  And he\nordered such a barrel to be brought, and the old woman to be put\ninto it with her daughter, and then the top was hammered on, and\nthe barrel rolled down hill until it went into the river.\n"
