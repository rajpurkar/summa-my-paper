S"There was once an enchantress, who had three sons who loved each\nother as brothers, but the old woman did not trust them, and\nthought they wanted to steal her power from her.  So she changed\nthe eldest into an eagle, which was forced to dwell in the rocky\nmountains, and was often seen flying in great circles in the sky.\nThe second, she changed into a whale, which lived in the deep sea,\nand all that was seen of it was that it sometimes spouted up a\ngreat jet of water in the air.  Each of them bore his\nhuman form for only two hours daily.  The third son, who was afraid\nshe might change him into a raging wild beast - a bear perhaps, or\na wolf, went secretly away.  He had heard that a king's daughter\nwho was bewitched, was imprisoned in the castle of the golden sun,\nand was waiting to be set free.  Those, however, who tried to free\nher risked their lives.  Three-and-twenty youths had already died\na miserable death, and now only one other might make the attempt,\nafter which no more must come.  And as his heart was without fear,\nhe made up his mind to seek out the castle of the golden sun.  He\nhad already traveled about for a long time without being able to\nfind it, when he came by chance into a great forest, and did not\nknow the way out of it.  All at once he saw in the distance two\ngiants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came\nto them they said, we are quarreling about a cap, and which of us\nit is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us\ncan get the better of the other.  The small men are cleverer than\nwe are, so we will leave the decision to you.  How can you\ndispute about an old cap, said the youth.  You do not know what\nproperties it has.  It is a wishing-cap, whosoever puts it on, can\nwish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be\nthere.  Give me the cap, said the youth, I will go a short\ndistance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the\ncap shall belong to the one who gets first to me.  He put it on\nand went away, and thought of the king's daughter, forgot the\ngiants, and walked continually onward.  At length he sighed from\nthe very bottom of his heart, and cried, ah, if I were but at the\ncastle of the golden sun.  And hardly had the words passed his\nlips than he was standing on a high mountain before the\ngate of the castle.\nHe entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he\nfound the king's daughter.  But how shocked he was when he saw\nher.  She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, bleary eyes,\nand red hair.  Are you the king's daughter, whose beauty the whole\nworld praises, cried he.  Ah, she answered, this is not my form,\nhuman eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that you\nmay know what I am like, look in the mirror - it does not let\nitself be misled - it will show you my image as it is in truth.\nShe gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the\nlikeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how\nthe tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief.  Then said he,\nhow can you be set free.  I fear no danger.  She said, he who gets\nthe crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy\nhis power with it, and I shall resume my true shape.  Ah, she\nadded, so many have already gone to meet death for this, and you\nare so young, I grieve that you should encounter such great\ndanger.  Nothing can keep me from doing it, said he, but tell me\nwhat I must do.  You shall know everything, said the king's\ndaughter, when you descend the mountain on which the castle stands,\na wild bull will stand below by a spring, and you must fight with\nit, and if you have the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring\nout of it, which bears in its body a red-hot egg, and in the egg\nthe crystal ball lies as its yolk.  The bird, however, will not\nlet the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the\nground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and\neven the egg itself will melt, and with it the crystal ball,\nand then your trouble will have been in vain.\nThe youth went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and\nbellowed at him.  After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the\nanimal's body, and it fell down.  Instantly a fiery bird arose\nfrom it and was about to fly away, but the young man's brother,\nthe eagle, who was passing between the clouds, swooped down,\nhunted it away to the sea, and struck it with his beak until, in\nits extremity, it let the egg fall.  The egg, however, did not\nfall into the sea, but on a fisherman's hut which stood on the\nshore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break\nout in flames.  Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house,\nwhich streamed over the hut, and subdued the fire.  The other\nbrother, the whale, had come swimming to them, and had driven the\nwater up on high.  When the fire was extinguished, the youth\nsought for the egg and happily found it, it was not yet melted,\nbut the shell was broken by being so suddenly cooled with the\nwater, and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt.\nWhen the youth went to the enchanter and held it before him,\nthe latter said, my power is destroyed, and from this time forth\nyou are the king of the castle of the golden sun.  With this you\ncan likewise give back to your brothers their human form.\nThen the youth hastened to the king's daughter, and when he\nentered the room, she was standing there in the full splendor\nof her beauty, and joyfully they exchanged rings with each other.\n"
