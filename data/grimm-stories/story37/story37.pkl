S"There was once a woman and her daughter who lived in a\npretty garden with cabbages.  And a little hare came into it,\nand during the winter time ate all the cabbages.  Then says the\nmother to the daughter, go into the garden, and chase the hare away.\n\nThe girl says to the little hare, sh-sh, hare, you will be eating\nall our cabbages.  Says the hare, come, maiden, and seat yourself\non my little hare's tail, and come with me into my\nlittle hare's hut.  The girl will not do it.\n\nNext day the hare\ncomes again and eats the cabbages, then says the mother to the\ndaughter, go into the garden, and drive the hare away.  The girl\nsays to the hare, sh-sh, little hare, you will be eating all the\ncabbages.  The little hare says, maiden, seat yourself on my\nlittle hare's tail, and come with me into my little hare's hut.\nThe maiden refuses.\n\nThe third day the hare comes again, and eats\nthe cabbages.  On this the mother says to the daughter, go into\nthe garden, and hunt the hare away.  Says the maiden, sh-sh, little\nhare, you will be eating all our cabbages.  Says the little\nhare, come, maiden, seat yourself on my little hare's tail,\nand come with me into my little hare's hut.\n\nThe girl seats\nherself on the little hare's tail, and then the hare takes her\nfar away to his little hut, and says, now cook green cabbage and\nmillet-seed, and I will invite the wedding-guests.  Then all\nthe wedding-guests assembled.  Who were the wedding-guests?\nThat I can tell you as another told it to me.  They were all\nhares, and the crow was there as parson to marry the bride\nand bridegroom, and the fox as clerk, and the altar was under\nthe rainbow.\n\nThe girl, however, was sad, for she was all alone.  The little hare\ncomes and says, open the doors, open the doors, the wedding-guests\nare merry.  The bride says nothing, but weeps.  The little\nhare goes away.  The little hare comes back and says, take off\nthe lid, take off the lid, the wedding-guests are hungry.  The\nbride again says nothing, and weeps.  The little hare goes away.\nThe little hare comes back and says, take off the lid, take off\nthe lid, the wedding-guests are waiting.  Then the bride says\nnothing, and the hare goes away, but she dresses a straw-doll\nin her clothes, and gives her a spoon to stir with, and sets\nher by the pan with the millet-seed, and goes back to her\nmother.  The little hare comes once more and says, take off\nthe lid, take off the lid, and gets up, and strikes the doll\non the head so that her cap falls off.\nThen the little hare sees that it is not his bride, and goes\naway and is sorrowful.\n"
