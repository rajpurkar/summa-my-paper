S"There was one upon a time a great war, and when it came to an end,\nmany soldiers were discharged.  Then brother lustig also received his\ndismissal, and with it nothing but a small loaf of ammunition-bread,\nand four kreuzers in money, with which he departed.\n\nSt. Peter, however, had placed himself in his way in the form of a\npoor beggar, and when brother lustig came up, he begged alms of him.\nBrother lustig replied, dear beggar-man, what am I to give you.  I\nhave been a soldier, and have received my dismissal, and have nothing\nbut this little loaf of ammunition-bread, and four kreuzers of money.\nWhen that is gone, I shall have to beg as well as you.  Still I will\ngive you something.\n\nThereupon he divided the loaf into four parts, and gave the apostle\none of them, and a kreuzer likewise.  St. Peter thanked him, went\nonwards, and threw himself again in the soldier's way as a beggar,\nbut in another shape, and when he came up begged a gift of him as\nbefore.\n\nBrother lustig spoke as he had done before, and again gave him a\nquarter of the loaf and one kreuzer.  St. Peter thanked him, and went\nonwards, but for the third time placed himself in another shape as a\nbeggar in the road, and spoke to brother lustig. Brother lustig gave\nhim also the third quarter of bread and the third kreuzer.  St. Peter\nthanked him, and brother lustig went onwards, and had but a quarter\nof the loaf, and one kreuzer.\n\nWith that he went into an inn, ate the bread, and ordered one\nkreuzer's worth of beer.  When he had had it, he journeyed onwards,\nand then St. Peter, who had assumed the appearance of a discharged\nsoldier, met and spoke to him thus.  Good day, comrade, can you not\ngive me a bit of bread, and a kreuzer to get a drink.  Where am I to\nprocure it, answered brother lustig. I have been discharged, and I\ngot nothing but a loaf of ammunition-bread and four kreuzers in\nmoney.  I met three beggars on the road, and I gave each of them a\nquarter of my bread, and one kreuzer.  The last quarter I ate in the\ninn, and had a drink with the last kreuzer.  Now my pockets are\nempty, and if you also have nothing we can go a-begging together.\n\nNo, answered St. Peter, we need not quite do that.  I know a little\nabout medicine, and I will soon earn as much as I require by that.\nIndeed, said brother lustig, I know nothing of that, so I must go and\nbeg alone.  Just come with me, said St. Peter, and if I earn\nanything, you shall have half of it.\n\nAll right, said brother lustig, and they went away together. Then\nthey came to a peasant's house inside which they heard loud\nlamentations and cries.  So they went in, and there the husband was\nlying sick unto death, and very near his end, and his wife was crying\nand weeping quite loudly.  Stop that howling and crying, said St.\nPeter, I will make the man well again, and he took a salve out of his\npocket, and healed the sick man in a moment, so that he could get up,\nand was in perfect health.\n\nIn great delight the man and his wife said, how can we reward you.\nWhat shall we give you.  But St. Peter would take nothing, and the\nmore the peasant folks offered him, the more he refused.  Brother\nlustig, however, nudged St. Peter, and said, take something.  Sure\nenough we are in need of it.\n\nAt length the woman brought a lamb and said to St. Peter that he\nreally must take that, but he would not. Then brother lustig gave him\na poke in the side, and said, do take it, you stupid fool.  We are in\ngreat want of it.  Then St. Peter said at last, well, I will take the\nlamb, but I won't carry it.  If you insist on having it, you must\ncarry it.  That is nothing, said brother lustig.  I will easily carry\nit, and took it on his shoulder.\n\nThen they departed and came to a wood, but brother lustig had begun\nto feel the lamb heavy, and he was hungry, so he said to St. Peter,\nlook, that's a good place, we might cook the lamb there, and eat it.\nAs you like, answered St. Peter, but I can't have anything to do with\nthe cooking.  If you will cook, there is a kettle for you, and in the\nmeantime I will walk about a little until it is ready.  But you must\nnot begin to eat until I have come back.  I will come at the right\ntime.  Well, go, then, said brother lustig.  I understand cookery, I\nwill manage it.\n\nThen St. Peter went away, and brother lustig killed the lamb, lighted\na fire, threw the meat into the kettle, and boiled it.  When the\nlamb, however, was quite ready, and the apostle peter had not come\nback, brother lustig took it out of the kettle, cut it up, and found\nthe heart. That is said to be the best part, said he, and tasted it,\nbut at last he ate it all up.  At length St. Peter returned and said,\nyou may eat the whole of the lamb yourself, I will only have the\nheart, give me that.\n\nThen brother lustig took a knife and fork, and pretended to look\nanxiously about amongst the lamb's flesh, but not to be able to find\nthe heart, and at last he said abruptly, there is none here.  But\nwhere can it be, said the apostle.  I don't know, replied brother\nlustig, but look, what fools we both are, to seek for the lamb's\nheart, and neither of us to remember that a lamb has no heart.  Oh,\nsaid St. Peter, that is something quite new.  Every animal has a\nheart, why is a lamb to have none.  No, be assured, my brother, said\nbrother lustig, that a lamb has no heart.  Just consider it\nseriously, and then you will see that it really has none.  Well, it\nis all right, said St. Peter.  If there is no heart, then I want none\nof the lamb.  You may eat it alone.\n\nWhat I can't eat now, I will carry away in my knapsack, said brother\nlustig, and he ate half the lamb, and put the rest in his knapsack.\n\nThey went farther, and then St. Peter caused a great stream of water\nto flow right across their path, and they were obliged to pass\nthrough it.  Said St. Peter, do you go first.  No, answered brother\nlustig, you must go first, and he thought, if the water is too deep I\nwill stay behind.  Then St. Peter strode through it, and the water\njust reached to his knee. So brother lustig began to go through also,\nbut the water grew deeper and reached to his throat.  Then he cried,\nbrother, help me.\n\nSt. Peter said, then will you confess that you have eaten the lamb's\nheart.  No, said he, I have not eaten it.  Then the water grew deeper\nstill and rose to his mouth.  Help me, brother, cried the soldier.\nSt. Peter said, then will you confess that you have eaten the lamb's\nheart.  No, he replied, I have not eaten it.  St. Peter, however,\nwould not let him be drowned, but made the water sink and helped him\nthrough it.\n\nThen they journeyed onwards, and came to a kingdom where they heard\nthat the king's daughter lay sick unto death.  Hi, there, brother,\nsaid the soldier to St. Peter, this is a chance for us.  If we can\nheal her we shall be provided for, for life.\n\nBut St. Peter was not half quick enough for him.  Come, lift your\nlegs, my dear brother, said he, that we may get there in time.  But\nSt. Peter walked slower and slower, though brother lustig did all he\ncould to drive and push him on, and at last they heard that the\nprincess was dead.  Now we are done for, said brother lustig.  That\ncomes of your sleepy way of walking.\n\nJust be quiet, answered St. Peter, I can do more than cure sick\npeople.  I can bring dead ones to life again.  Well, if you can do\nthat, said brother lustig, it's all right, but you should earn at\nleast half the kingdom for us by that.  Then they went to the royal\npalace, where everyone was in great grief, but St. Peter told the\nking that he would restore his daughter to life.  He was taken to\nher, and said, bring me a kettle and some water, and when that was\nbrought, he bade everyone go out, and allowed no one to remain with\nhim but brother lustig.  Then he cut off all the dead girl's limbs,\nand threw them in the water, lighted a fire beneath the kettle, and\nboiled them.  And when the flesh had fallen away from the bones, he\ntook out the beautiful white bones, and laid them on a table, and\narranged them together in their natural order.  When he had done\nthat, he stepped forward and said three times, in the name of the\nholy trinity, dead woman, arise.  And at the third time, the princess\narose, living, healthy and beautiful.\n\nThen the king was in the greatest joy, and said to St. Peter, ask for\nyour reward.  Even if it were half my kingdom, I would give it.  But\nSt. Peter said, I want nothing for it.  Oh, you tomfool, thought\nbrother lustig to himself, and nudged his comrade's side, and said,\ndon't be so stupid. If you have no need of anything, I have.  St.\nPeter, however, would have nothing, but as the king saw that the\nother would very much like to have something, he ordered his\ntreasurer to fill brother lustig's knapsack with gold.\n\nThen they went on their way, and when they came to a forest, St.\nPeter said to brother lustig, now, we will divide the gold.  Yes, he\nreplied, we will.  So St. Peter divided the gold, and divided it into\nthree heaps.  Brother lustig thought to himself, what crazy idea has\nhe got in his head now.  He is making three shares, and there are\nonly two of us.  But St. Peter said, I have divided it exactly.\nThere is one share for me, one for you and one for him who ate the\nlamb's heart.\n\nOh, I ate that, replied brother lustig, and hastily swept up the\ngold.  You may trust what I say.  But how can that be true, said St.\nPeter, when a lamb has no heart.  Eh, what, brother, what can you be\nthinking of.  Lambs have hearts like other animals, why should only\nthey have none.  Well, so be it, said St. Peter, keep the gold to\nyourself, but I will stay with you no longer.  I will go my way\nalone.  As you like, dear brother, answered brother lustig.\nFarewell.\n\nThen St. Peter went a different road, but brother lustig thought, it\nis a good thing that he has taken himself off, he is certainly a\nstrange saint.  Then he had money enough, but did not know how to\nmanage it, squandered it, gave it away, and and when some time had\ngone by, once more had nothing.  Then he arrived in a certain country\nwhere he heard that a king's daughter was dead.\n\nOh, ho, thought he, that may be a good thing for me.  I will bring\nher to life again, and see that I am paid as I ought to be.  So he\nwent to the king, and offered to raise the dead girl to life again.\nNow the king had heard that a discharged soldier was traveling about\nand bringing dead persons to life again, and thought that brother\nlustig was the man.  But as he had no confidence in him, he consulted\nhis councillors first, who said that he might give it a trial as his\ndaughter was dead.\n\nThen brother lustig ordered water to be brought to him in a kettle,\nbade every one go out, cut the limbs off, threw them in the water and\nlighted a fire beneath, just as he had seen St. Peter do.  The water\nbegan to boil, the flesh fell off, and then he took the bones out and\nlaid them on the table, but he did not know the order in which to lay\nthem, and placed them all wrong and in confusion.  Then he stood\nbefore them and said, in the name of the most holy trinity, dead\nmaiden, I bid you arise, and he said this thrice, but the bones did\nnot stir. So he said it thrice more, but also in vain.  Confounded\ngirl that you are, get up, cried he, get up, or it shall be the worse\nfor you.\n\nWhen he had said that, St. Peter suddenly appeared in his former\nshape as a discharged soldier.  He entered by the window and said,\ngodless man, what are you doing.  How can the dead maiden arise, when\nyou have thrown about her bones in such confusion.  Dear brother, I\nhave done everything to the best of my ability, he answered.  This\nonce, I will help you out of your difficulty, but one thing I tell\nyou, and that is that if ever you undertake anything of the kind\nagain, it will be the worse for you, and also that you must neither\ndemand nor accept the smallest thing from the king for this.\n\nThereupon St. Peter laid the bones in their right order, said to the\nmaiden three times, in the name of the most holy trinity, dead\nmaiden, arise, and the king's daughter arose, healthy and beautiful\nas before.  Then St. Peter went away again by the window, and brother\nlustig was rejoiced to find that all had passed off so well, but was\nvery much vexed to think that after all he was not to take anything\nfor it.  I should just like to know, thought he, what fancy that\nfellow has got in his head, for what he gives with one hand he takes\naway with the other - there is no sense whatever in it.\n\nThen the king offered brother lustig whatsoever he wished to have,\nbut he did not dare to take anything.  However, by hints and cunning,\nhe contrived to make the king order his knapsack to be filled with\ngold for him, and with that he departed.  When he got out, St. Peter\nwas standing by the door, and said, just look what a man you are.\nDid I not forbid you to take anything, and there you have your\nknapsack full of gold.  How can I help that, answered brother lustig,\nif people will put it in for me.  Well, I tell you this, that if ever\nyou set about anything of this kind again you shall suffer for it.\nAll right, brother, have no fear, now I have money, why should I\ntrouble myself with washing bones.  Faith, said St. Peter, a long\ntime that gold will last.  In order that after this you may never\ntread in forbidden paths, I will bestow on your knapsack this\nproperty, namely, that whatsoever you wish to have inside it, shall\nbe there.  Farewell, you will now never see me more.  Good-bye, said\nbrother lustig, and thought to himself, I am very glad that you have\ntaken yourself off, you strange fellow.  I shall certainly not follow\nyou.  But of the magical power which had been bestowed on his\nknapsack, he thought no more.\n\nBrother lustig traveled about with his money, and squandered and\nwasted what he had as before.  When at last he had no more than four\nkreuzers, he passed by an inn and thought, the money must go, and\nordered three kreuzers, worth of wine and one kreuzer's worth of\nbread for himself.  As he was sitting there drinking, the smell of\nroast goose made its way to his nose.\n\nBrother lustig looked about and peeped, and saw that the host had two\ngeese roasting in the oven.  Then he remembered that his comrade had\nsaid that whatsoever he wished to have in his knapsack should be\nthere, so he said, oh, ho.  I must try that with the geese.  So he\nwent out, and when he was outside the door, he said, I wish those two\nroasted geese out of the oven and in my knapsack, and when he had\nsaid that, he unbuckled it and looked in, and there they were inside\nit.  Ah, that's right, said he, now I am a made man, and went away to\na meadow and took out the roast meat.\n\nWhen he was in the midst of his meal, two journeymen came up and\nlooked at the second goose, which was not yet touched, with hungry\neyes.  Brother lustig thought to himself, one is enough for me, and\ncalled the two men up and said, take the goose, and eat it to my\nhealth.  They thanked him, and went with it to the inn, ordered\nthemselves a half bottle of wine and a loaf, took out the goose which\nhad been given them, and began to eat.\n\nThe hostess saw them and said to her husband, those two are eating a\ngoose.  Just look and see if it is not one of ours, out of the oven.\nThe landlord ran thither, and behold the oven was empty.  What, cried\nhe, you thievish crew, you want to eat goose as cheap as that.  Pay\nfor it this moment, or I will wash you well with green hazel-sap.\nThe two said, we are no thieves, a discharged soldier gave us the\ngoose, outside there in the meadow.  You shall not throw dust in my\neyes that way. The soldier was here, but he went out by the door,\nlike an honest fellow.  I looked after him myself.  You are the\nthieves and shall pay.  But as they could not pay, he took a stick,\nand cudgeled them out of the house.\n\nBrother lustig went his way and came to a place where there was a\nmagnificent castle, and not far from it a wretched inn. He went to\nthe inn and asked for a night's lodging, but the landlord turned him\naway, and said, there is no more room here, the house is full of\nnoble guests.  It surprises me that they should come to you and not\ngo to that splendid castle, said brother lustig.  Ah, indeed, replied\nthe host, but it is no slight matter to sleep there for a night.  No\none who has tried it so far, has ever come out of it alive.\n\nIf others have tried it, said brother lustig, I will try it too.\nLeave it alone, said the host, it will cost you your neck.  It won't\nkill me at once, said brother lustig, just give me the key, and some\ngood food and wine.  So the host gave him the key, and food and wine,\nand with this brother lustig went into the castle, enjoyed his\nsupper, and at length, as he was sleepy, he lay down on the ground,\nfor there was no bed.  He soon fell asleep, but during the night was\ndisturbed by a great noise, and when he awoke, he saw nine ugly\ndevils in the room, who had made a circle, and were dancing around\nhim.\n\nBrother lustig said, well, dance as long as you like, but none of you\nmust come too close.  But the devils pressed continually nearer to\nhim, and almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet.  Stop,\nyou devils, ghosts, said he, but they behaved still worse.  Then\nbrother lustig grew angry, and cried, stop.  You'll soon see how I\ncan make you quiet, and got the leg of a chair and struck out into\nthe midst of them with it.  But nine devils against one soldier were\nstill too many, and when he struck those in front of him, the others\nseized him behind by the hair, and tore it unmercifully.\n\nDevils, crew, cried he, this is too much, but just wait.  Into my\nknapsack, all nine of you.  In an instant they were in it, and then\nhe buckled it up and threw it into a corner.  After this all was\nsuddenly quiet, and brother lustig lay down again, and slept till it\nwas bright day.\n\nThen came the inn-keeper, and the nobleman to whom the castle\nbelonged, to see how he had fared.  But when they perceived that he\nwas merry and well they were astonished, and asked, have the spirits\ndone you no harm, then.  The reason why they have not, answered\nbrother lustig, is because I have got the whole nine of them in my\nknapsack.\n\nYou may once more inhabit your castle quite tranquilly, none of them\nwill ever haunt it again.  The nobleman thanked him, made him rich\npresents, and begged him to remain in his service, and he would\nprovide for him as long as he lived.  No, replied brother lustig, I\nam used to wandering about, I will travel farther.\n\nThen he went away, and entered into a smithy, laid the knapsack,\nwhich contained the nine devils on the anvil, and asked the smith and\nhis apprentices to strike it. So they smote with their great hammers\nwith all their strength, and the devils uttered howls which were\nquite pitiable.  When he opened the knapsack after this, eight of\nthem were dead, but one which had been lying in a fold of it, was\nstill alive, slipped out, and went back again to hell.\n\nThereupon brother lustig traveled a long time about the world, and\nthose who know, can tell many a story about him.  But at last he grew\nold, and thought of his end, so he went to a hermit who was known to\nbe a pious man, and said to him, I am tired of wandering about, and\nwant now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the\nkingdom of heaven.  The hermit replied, there are two roads, one is\nbroad and pleasant, and leads to hell, the other is narrow and rough,\nand leads to heaven.  I should be a fool, thought brother lustig, if\nI were to take the narrow, rough road.\n\nSo he set out and took the broad and pleasant road, and at length\ncame to a great black door, which was the door of hell.  Brother\nlustig knocked, and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there.\nBut when he saw brother lustig, he was terrified, for he was the very\nsame ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack, and had\nescaped from it with a black eye.\n\nSo he pushed the bolt in again as quickly as he could, ran to the\nhighest devil, and said, there is a fellow outside with a knapsack,\nwho wants to come in, but as you value your lives don't allow him to\nenter, or he will wish the whole of hell into his knapsack.  He once\ngave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it.\n\nSo they called out to brother lustig that he was to go away again,\nfor he should not get in there.  If they won't have me here, thought\nhe, I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven, for I must\nstay somewhere.\n\nSo he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of\nheaven, where he knocked.  St. Peter was sitting hard by as\ndoor-keeper.  Brother lustig recognized him at once, and thought,\nhere I find an old friend, I shall get on better.  But St. Peter\nsaid, I can hardly believe that you want to come into heaven.  Let me\nin, brother.  I must get in somewhere.  If they would have taken me\ninto hell, I should not have come here.  No, said St. Peter, you\nshall not enter.  Then if you will not let me in, take your knapsack\nback, for I will have nothing at all from you.  Give it here, then,\nsaid St. Peter.  Then brother lustig gave him the knapsack into\nheaven through the bars, and St. Peter took it, and hung it beside\nhis seat.  Then said brother lustig, and now I wish myself inside my\nknapsack, and in a second he was in it, and in heaven, and St. Peter\nwas forced to let him stay there.\n"
