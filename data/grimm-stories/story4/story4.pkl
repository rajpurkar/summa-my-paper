S'Master Pfriem is a cobbler by trade who has the annoying habit of criticizing everything. He is not able to sit still long enough to finish a single shoe because he constantly feels obliged to go out and tell others what they are doing wrong. One night, Master Pfriem dreams he dies and goes to heaven. At the gate, the apostle Peter warns Master Pfriem that in heaven he must not criticize what he sees or else he will experience bad luck. At first, Master Pfriem sees things that irk him in heaven, but he manages to keep his mouth shut. Finally, however, when he sees angels harnessing horses to both the front and back of a cart, Master Pfriem cannot hold back any longer. He criticizes the angels for their stupidity in harnessing the horses this way. The angels grab him and throw him...'

S"Master pfriem was a short, thin, but lively man, who never\nrested a moment.  His face, of which his turned-up nose was\nthe only prominent feature, was marked with smallpox and pale as\ndeath.  His hair was gray and shaggy, his eyes small, but they\nglanced perpetually about on all sides.  He saw everything,\ncriticized everything, knew everything best, and was always in\nthe right.  When he went into the streets, he moved his arms\nabout as if he were rowing, and once he struck the pail of a girl\nso high in the air that he himself was wetted all over by the\nwater she was carrying.  Idiot.  Cried he to her, shaking\nhimself, could you not see that I was coming behind you.  By trade\nhe was a shoemaker, and when he worked he pulled his thread out\nwith such force that he drove his fist into everyone who did not\nkeep far enough off.  No apprentice stayed more than a month with\nhim, for he had always some fault to find with the very best work.\nAt one time it was that the stitches were not even, at another\nthat one shoe was too long, or one heel higher than the other,\nor the leather not cut large enough.  Wait, said he to his\napprentice, I will soon show you how we make skins soft.  And\nhe brought a strap and gave him a couple of lashes across the\nback.  He called them all sluggards.  He\nhimself did not turn much work out of his hands, for he never sat\nstill for a quarter of an hour.  If his wife got up very early in\nthe morning and lighted the fire, he jumped out of bed, and ran\nbarefooted into the kitchen, crying, will you burn my house down\nfor me.  That is a fire one could roast an ox by.  Does wood cost\nnothing.  If the servants were standing by their wash-tubs and\nlaughing, and telling each other what they knew, he scolded them,\nand said, there stand the geese cackling, and forgetting their\nwork, to gossip.  And why fresh soap.  Disgraceful extravagance\nand shameful idleness into the bargain.  They want to save their\nhands, and not rub the things properly.  And out he would run and\nknock a pail full of soap and water over, so that the whole\nkitchen was flooded.  Someone was building a new house, so he\nhurrried to the window to look on.  There, they are using that\nred sand-stone again that never dries, cried he.  No one will\never be healthy in that house.  And just look how badly the\nfellows are laying the stones.  Besides, the mortar is good for\nnothing.  It ought to have gravel in it, not sand.  I shall live\nto see that house tumble down on the people who are in it.\nHe sat down, put a couple of stitches in, and then jumped up\nagain, unfastened his leather-apron, and cried, I will just go\nout, and appeal to those men's consciences.  He stumbled on the\ncarpenters.  What's this, cried he, you are not working by the\nline.  Do you expect the beams to be straight - one wrong will\nput all wrong.  He snatched an axe out of a carpenter's hand and\nwanted to show him how he ought to cut, but as a cart loaded\nwith clay came by, he threw the axe away, and hastened to the\npeasant who was walking by the side of it, you are not in your\nright mind, said he, who yokes young horses to a heavily-laden\ncart.  The poor beasts will die on the spot.  The peasant did\nnot give him an answer, and pfriem in a rage ran back into his\nwork-shop.  When he was setting himself to work again, the\napprentice reached him a shoe.  Well, what's that again, screamed\nhe, haven't I told you you ought not to cut shoes so broad.  Who\nwould buy a shoe like this, which is hardly anything else but a\nsole.  I insist on my orders being followed exactly.  Master,\nanswered the apprentice, you may easily be quite right about the\nshoe being a bad one, but it is the one which you yourself cut\nout, and yourself set to work at.  When you jumped up a while\nago, you knocked it off the table, and I have only just picked it\nup.  An angel from heaven, however, would never make you believe\nthat.\nOne night master pfriem dreamed he was dead, and on his way to\nheaven.  When he got there, he knocked loudly at the door.  I\nwonder, said he to himself, that they have no knocker on the door,\none knocks one's knuckles sore.  The apostle peter opened the door,\nand wanted to see who demanded admission so noisily.  Ah, it's you\nmaster pfriem, said he, well, I'll let you in, but I warn you\nthat you must give up that habit of yours, and find fault with\nnothing you see in heaven, or you may fare ill.  You might have\nspared your warning, answered pfriem.  I know already what is\nseemly, and here, God be thanked, everything is perfect, and there\nis nothing to blame as there is on earth.  So he went in, and\nwalked up and down the wide expanses of heaven.  He looked\naround him, to the left and to the right, but sometimes shook his\nhead, or muttered something to himself.  Then he saw two angels\nwho were carrying away a beam.  It was the beam which someone had\nhad in his own eye whilst he was looking for the splinter in the\neye of another.  They did not carry the beam lengthways,\nhowever, but obliquely.  Did anyone ever see such a piece of\nstupidity, thought master pfriem.  But he said nothing, and seemed\nsatisfied with it.  It comes to the same thing after all,\nwhichever way they carry the beam, straight or athwart, if they\nonly get along with it, and truly I do not see them knock against\nanything.  Soon after this he saw two angels who were drawing\nwater out of a well into a bucket, but at the same time he\nobserved that the bucket was full of holes, and that the water\nwas running out of it on every side.  They were watering the\nearth with rain.  Hang it, he exclaimed, but happily recollected\nhimself, and thought, perhaps it is only a pastime.  If it is\nan amusement, then it seems they can do useless things of this\nkind, especially here in heaven, where people, as I have already\nnoticed, do nothing but idle about.  He went farther\nand saw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole.  It's no\nwonder, said he to the man who stood by, who would load so\nunreasonably.  What have you there.  Good wishes, replied the man,\nI could not get on the right way with it, but still I have pushed\nit safely up here, and here they won't leave me stuck.  In fact\nan angel did come and harness two horses to it.  That's quite\nright, thought pfriem, but two horses won't get that cart out, it\nmust at least have four to it.  Another angel came and brought\ntwo more horses, she did not harness them in front of it,\nhowever, but behind.  That was too much for master pfriem, clumsy\ncreature, he burst out, what are you doing there.  Has anyone\never since the world began seen a cart drawn in that way.  But\nyou, in your conceited arrogance, think that you know everything\nbest.  He was going to say more, but one of the inhabitants of\nheaven seized him by the throat and pushed him forth with\nirresistible strength.  Beneath the gateway master pfriem turned\nhis head round to take one more look at the cart, and saw that it\nwas being raised into the air by four winged horses.\nAt this moment master pfriem awoke.  Things are certainly\narranged in heaven otherwise than they are on earth, said he to\nhimself, and that excuses much, but who can see horses harnessed\nboth behind and before with patience.  To be sure they had wings\nbut who could know that.  It is, beside, great folly to fix a\npair of wings to a horse that has four legs to run with already.\nBut I must get up, or else they will make nothing but mistakes\nin my house.  It is a lucky thing though, that I am not\nreally dead.\n"
