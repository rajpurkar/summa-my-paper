S"There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the\nhearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and spun.  Then\nsaid he, how sad it is that we have no children.  With us all\nis so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively.\nYes, replied the wife, and sighed, even if we had only one,\nand it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be\nquite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts.\nNow it so happened that the woman fell ill, and after seven\nmonths gave birth to a child, that was perfect in all its limbs,\nbut no longer than a thumb.  Then said they, it is as we wished\nit to be, and it shall be our dear child.  And because of its\nsize, they called it thumbling.  Though they did not let it want\nfor food, the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had\nbeen at the first.  Nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its\neyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature,\nfor everything it did turned out well.\n\nOne day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to\ncut wood, when he said as if to himself, how I wish that there\nwas someone who would bring the cart to me.  Oh father, cried\nthumbling, I will soon bring the cart, rely on that.  It shall\nbe in the forest at the appointed time.  The man smiled and\nsaid, how can that be done, you are far too small to lead the\nhorse by the reins.  That's of no consequence, father, if my\nmother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse's ear\nand call out to him how he is to go.  Well, answered the man,\nfor once we will try it.\n\nWhen the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed\nthumbling in its ear, and then the little creature cried, gee\nup, gee up.\n\nThen it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart\nwent the right way into the forest.  It so happened that just\nas he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, gee\nup, two strange men came towards him.  My word, said one of them,\nwhat is this.  There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to\nthe horse and still he is not to be seen.  That can't be right,\nsaid the other, we will follow the cart and see where it stops.  The\ncart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the\nplace where the wood had been cut.  When thumbling saw his\nfather, he cried to him, do you see, father, here I am with the\ncart, now take me down.  The father got hold of the horse with\nhis left hand and with the right took his little son out of the\near.  Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the\ntwo strange men\nsaw him, they did not know what to say for\nastonishment.  Then one of them took the other aside and said,\nlisten, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited\nhim in a large town, for money.  We will buy him.  They went to\nthe peasant and said, sell us the little man.  He shall be well\ntreated with us.  No, replied the father, he is the apple of my\neye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me.\n\nThumbling, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up\nthe folds of his father's coat, placed himself on his shoulder,\nand whispered in his ear, father do give me away, I will soon\ncome back again.  Then the father parted with him to the two\nmen for a handsome sum of money.  Where will you sit, they\nsaid to him.  Oh just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I\ncan walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and\nstill not fall down.  They did as he wished, and when thumbling\nhad taken leave of his father, they went away with him.  They\nwalked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said,\ndo take me down, it is necessary.  Just stay up there, said the\nman on whose hat he sat, it makes no difference to me.  The birds\nsometimes let things fall on me.  No, said thumbling, I\nknow what's manners, take me quickly down.  The man took his hat\noff, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and\nhe leapt and crept about a little between the sods, and then he\nsuddenly slipped into a mousehole which he had sought out.\nGood evening, gentlemen, just go home without me, he cried to\nthem, and mocked them.  They ran thither and stuck their sticks\ninto the mousehole, but it was all in vain.  Thumbling crept\nstill farther in, and as it soon became quite\ndark, they were forced to go home with their vexation and\ntheir empty purses.\n\nWhen thumbling saw that they were gone, he crept back out of the\nsubterranean passage.  It is so dangerous to walk on the ground\nin the dark, said he, how easily a neck or a leg is broken.\nFortunately he stumbled against an empty snail-shell.  Thank God,\nsaid he, in that I can pass the night in safety.  And got into it.\nNot long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two\nmen go by, and one of them was saying, how shall we set about\ngetting hold of the rich pastor's silver and gold.  I could tell\nyou that, cried thumbling, interrupting them.  What was that, said\none of the thieves in fright, I heard someone speaking.  They stood\nstill listening, and thumbling spoke again, and said, take\nme with you, and I'll help you.\n\nBut where are you.  Just look on the ground, and observe from\nwhence my voice comes, he replied.  There the thieves at length\nfound him, and lifted him up.  You little imp, how will you help\nus, they said.  Listen, said he, I will creep into the pastor's\nroom through the iron bars, and will reach out to you whatever\nyou want to have.  Come then, they said, and we will see what you\ncan do.  When they got to the pastor's house, thumbling crept into\nthe room, but instantly cried out with all his might, do you want\nto have everything that is here.  The thieves were alarmed, and\nsaid, but do speak softly, so as not to waken any one.  Thumbling\nhowever, behaved as if he had not understood this, and cried\nagain, what do you want.  Do you want to have everything that is\nhere.  The cook, who slept in the next room, heard this and sat up\nin bed, and listened.  The thieves, however, had in their fright\nrun some distance away, but at last they took courage, and\nthought, the little rascal wants to mock us.  They came back and\nwhispered to him, come be serious, and reach something out to us.\nThen thumbling again cried as loudly as he could, I really will\ngive you everything, just put your hands in.  The maid who was\nlistening, heard this quite distinctly, and jumped out of bed\nand rushed to the door.  The thieves took flight, and ran as if\nthe wild huntsman\nwere behind them, but as the maid could not see\nanything, she went to strike a light.  When she came to the\nplace with it, thumbling, unperceived, betook himself to the\ngranary, and the maid after she had examined every corner and\nfound nothing, lay down in her bed again, and believed that,\nafter all, she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears.\nThumbling had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful\nplace to sleep in.  There he intended to rest until day, and\nthen go home again to his parents.  But there were other things in\nstore for him.  Truly, there is much worry and affliction in\nthis world.  When the day dawned, the maid arose from her bed to\nfeed the cows.  Her first walk was into the barn, where she laid\nhold of an armful of hay, and precisely that very one in which\npoor thumbling was lying asleep.  He, however, was sleeping so\nsoundly that he was aware of nothing, and did not awake until he\nwas in the mouth of the cow, who had picked him up with the hay.\n\nAh, heavens, cried he, how have I got into the fulling mill.  But\nhe soon discovered where he was. Then he had to take care not to\nlet himself go between the teeth and be dismembered, but he was\nsubsequently forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay.\nIn this little room the windows are forgotten, said he, and no\nsun shines in, neither will a candle be brought.  His quarters\nwere especially unpleasing to him, and the worst was that more\nand more hay was always coming in by the door, and the space grew\nless and less.  When at length in his anguish, he cried as\nloud as he could, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more\nfodder.  The maid was just milking the cow, and when she heard\nsome one speaking, and saw no one, and perceived that it was the\nsame voice that she had heard in the night, she was so\nterrified that she slipped off her stool, and spilt the milk.\n\nShe ran in great haste to her master, and said, oh heavens,\npastor, the cow has been speaking.  You are mad, replied the\npastor, but he went himself to the byre to see what was there.\nHardly, however had he set his foot inside when thumbling again\ncried, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder.  Then\nthe pastor himself was alarmed, and thought that an evil\nspirit had gone into the cow, and ordered her to be killed.  She was\nkilled, but the stomach, in which thumbling was, was thrown on\nthe dunghill.  Thumbling had great difficulty in working his\nway out.  However, he succeeded so far as to get some room, but\njust as he was going to thrust his head out, a new misfortune\noccurred.  A hungry wolf ran thither, and swallowed the whole\nstomach at one gulp.  Thumbling did not lose courage.  Perhaps,\nthought he, the wolf will listen to what I have got to say.  And\nhe called to him from out of his belly, dear wolf, I know of a\nmagnificent feast for you.\n\nWhere is it to be had, said the wolf.\nIn such and such a house.  You must creep into it through the\nkitchen-sink, and will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, and\nas much of them as you can eat.  And he described to him exactly\nhis father's house.  The wolf did not require to be told this\ntwice, squeezed himself in at night through the sink, and ate to\nhis heart's content in the larder.  When he had eaten his fill,\nhe wanted to go out again, but he had become so big that he could\nnot go out by the same way.  Thumbling had reckoned on this, and\nnow began to make a violent noise in the wolf's body, and raged\nand screamed as loudly as he could.  Will you be quiet, said the\nwolf, you will waken up the people.  What do I care, replied the\nlittle fellow, you have eaten your fill, and I will make merry\nlikewise.  And began once more to scream with all his strength.\n\nAt last his father and mother were aroused by it, and ran to the\nroom and looked in through the opening in the door.  When they\nsaw that a wolf was inside, they ran away, and teh husband\nfetched his axe, and the wife the scythe.  Stay behind, said the\nman, when they entered the room.  When I have given the blow, if\nhe is not killed by it, you must cut him down and hew his body\nto pieces.  Then thumbling heard his parents, voices and cried,\ndear father, I am here, I am in the wolf's body.  Said the father,\nfull of joy, thank God, our dear child has found us again. And\nbade the\nwoman take away her scythe, that thumbling might not be hurt\nwith it.  After that he raised his arm, and struck the wolf\nsuch a blow on his head that he fell down\ndead, and then they got knives and scissors and cut his body open\nand drew the little fellow forth.\n\nAh, said the father, what sorrow we have gone through for your\nsake.  Yes father, I have gone about the world a great deal.\nThank heaven, I breathe fresh air again.  Where have you been,\nthen.  Ah, father, I have been in a mouse's hole, in a cow's\nbelly, and then in a wolf's paunch.  Now I will stay with you.\nAnd we will not sell you again, no not for all the riches in\nthe world, said his parents, and they embraced and kissed their\ndear thumbling.  They gave him to eat and to drink, and had\nsome new clothes made for him, for his own had been spoiled\non his journey.\n"
