S"There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt,\nand as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a\nlittle child were there.  He followed the sound, and at last\ncame to a high tree, and at the top of this a little child was\nsitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the\nchild, and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms, had flown down,\nsnatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\n\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to\nhimself, you will take him home with you, and bring him up with\nyour lina.  He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew\nup together.  And the one, which he had found on a tree was called\nfundevogel, because a bird had carried it away.  Fundevogel and\nlina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each\nother they were sad.\n\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails\nand began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times,\nout to the spring.  Lina saw this and said, listen old sanna, why\nare you fetching so much water.  If you will never repeat it to\nanyone, I will tell you why.  So lina said, no, she would never\nrepeat it to anyone, and then the cook said, early tomorrow\nmorning, when the forester is out hunting, I will heat the water,\nand when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in fundevogel,\nand will boil him in it.\n\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and\nwhen he was gone the children were still in bed.  Then lina said\nto fundevogel, if you will never leave me, I too will never\nleave you.  Fundevogel said, neither now, nor ever will I leave\nyou.  Then said lina, then I will tell you.  Last night, old\nsanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked\nher why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise\nnot to tell anyone she would tell me, and I said I would be\nsure not to tell anyone, and she said that early to-morrow morning\nwhen father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of\nwater, throw you into it and boil you, but we will get up quickly,\ndress ourselves, and go away together.\n\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and\nwent away.  When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook\nwent into the bed-room to fetch fundevogel and throw him into\nit.  But when she came in, and went to the beds, both the children\nwere gone.  Then she was terribly alarmed, and she said to herself,\nwhat shall I say now when the forester comes home and sees that\nthe children are gone.  They must be followed instantly to get\nthem back again.\n\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\novertake the children.  The children, however, were sitting\noutside the forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants\nrunning, lina said to fundevoel, never leave me, and I will never\nleave you.  Fundevogel said, neither now, nor ever.  Then said\nlina, do you become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.  When\nthe three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a\nrose-tree and one rose on it, but the children were nowhere.\n\nThen said they, there is nothing to be done here, and they went\nhome and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest\nbut a little rose-bush with one rose on it.  Then the old cook\nscolded and said, you simpletons, you simpletons, you should have\ncut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought\nit home with you, go, and do it once.  They had therefore to go\nout and look for the second time.  The children, however, saw them\ncoming from a distance.  Then lina said, fundevogel, never leave\nme, and I will never leave you.  Fundevogel said, neither now,\nnor ever.  Said lina, then do you become a church, and I'll be\nthe chandelier in it.  So when the three servants came,\nnothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in it.  They\nsaid therefore to each other, what can we do here, let us go home.\n\nWhen they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them, so\nthey said no, they had found nothing but a church, and that\nthere was a chandelier in it.  And the cook scolded them and said,\nyou fools, why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring\nthe chandelier home with you.  And now the old cook herself got\non her legs, and went with the three servants in pursuit of the\nchildren.  The children, however, saw from afar that the three\nservants were coming, and the cook waddling after them.  Then\nsaid lina, fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\nyou.  Then said fundevogel, neither now, nor ever.  Said lina,\nbe a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.  The cook,\nhowever, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay\ndown by it, and was about to drink it up.  But the duck swam\nquickly to her, seized her head in its beak and drew her into the\nwater, and there the old witch had to drown.  Then the\nchildren went home together, and were heartily delighted, and\nif they have not died, they are living still.\n"
