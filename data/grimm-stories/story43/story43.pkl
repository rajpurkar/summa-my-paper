S"There was once a king's son who was seized with a desire to travel\nabout the world, and took no one with him but a faithful servant.\nOne day he came to a great forest, and when darkness overtook him\nhe could find no shelter, and knew not where to pass the night.\nThen he saw a girl who was going towards a small house, and when\nhe came nearer, he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful.\nHe spoke to her, and said, dear child, can I and my servant find\nshelter for the night in the little house.  Oh, yes, said the\ngirl in a sad voice, that you certainly can, but I do not advise\nyou to venture it.  Do not go in.  Why not, asked the king's son.\nThe maiden sighed and said, my step-mother\npractises wicked arts.  She is ill-disposed toward strangers.\nThen he saw very well that he had come to the house of a witch,\nbut as it was dark, and he could not go farther, and also was\nnot afraid, he entered.  The old woman was sitting in an armchair\nby the fire, and looked at the stranger with her red eyes.  Good\nevening, growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly.  Take\na seat and rest yourselves.  She fanned the fire on which she was\ncooking something in a small pot.  The daughter warned the two to\nbe prudent, to eat nothing, and drink nothing, for the old woman\nbrewed evil drinks.  They slept quietly until early morning.  When\nthey were making ready for their departure, and the king's son was\nalready seated on his horse, the old woman said, stop a moment,\nI will first hand you a parting draught.  Whilst she fetched\nit, the king's son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle\nhis saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch\ncame with the drink.  Take that to your master, said she.  But\nat that instant the glass broke and the poison spirted on the\nhorse, and it was so strong that the animal immediately fell down\ndead.  The servant ran after his master and told him what had\nhappened, but as he did not want to leave his saddle behind, he\nran back to fetch it.  When he came to the dead horse, however,\na raven was already sitting on it devouring it.  Who knows\nwhether we shall find anything better to-day, said the servant.\nSo he killed the raven, and took it with him.  And now they\njourneyed onwards into the forest the whole day, but could not\nget out of it.  By nightfall they found an inn and entered it.\nThe servant gave the raven to the innkeeper to prepare for supper.\nThey had stumbled, however, on a den of murderers, and during\nthe darkness twelve of these came, intending to kill the strangers\nand rob them.  But before they set about this work, they sat down\nto supper, and the innkeeper and the witch sat down with them,\nand together they ate a dish of soup in which was cut up the\nflesh of the raven.  Hardly had they swallowed a couple of\nmouthfuls, before they all fell down dead, for the raven had\ncommunicated to them the poison from the horse-flesh.  There\nwas no no one else left in the house but the innkeeper's daughter,\nwho was\nhonest, and had taken no part in their godless deeds.  She\nopened all doors to the stranger and showed him the store of\ntreasures.  But the king's son said she might keep everything, he\nwould have none of it, and rode onwards with his servant.\nAfter they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a\ntown in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had made it\nknown that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could\nnot guess, that man should be her husband.  But if she guessed\nit, his head must be cut off.  She had three days to guess it\nin, but was so clever that she always found the answer to the\nriddle given her before the appointed time.  Nine suitors had\nalready perished in this manner, when the king's son arrived, and\nblinded by her great beauty, was willing to stake his life for\nit.  Then he went to her and laid his riddle before her.  What\nis this, said he.  One slew none, and yet slew twelve.  She\ndid not know what that was.  She thought and thought, but she\ncould not solve it.  She opened her riddle-books, but it was\nnot in them - in short, her wisdom was at an end.  As she\ndid not know how to help herself, she ordered her maid to\ncreep into the lord's sleeping-chamber, and listen to his\ndreams, and thought that he would perhaps speak in his sleep\nand reveal the riddle.  But the clever servant had placed\nhimself in the bed instead of his master, and when the maid\ncame there, he tore off from her the mantle in which she had\nwrapped herself, and chased her out with rods.  The second night\nthe king's daughter sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to see\nif she could succeed better in listening, but the servant\ntook her mantle also away from her, and hunted her out with\nrods.  Now the master believed himself safe for the third\nnight, and lay down in his own bed.  Then came the princess\nherself, and she had put on a misty-grey mantle, and she\nseated herself near him.  And when she thought that he was\nasleep and dreaming, she spoke to him, and hoped that he\nwould answer in his sleep, as many do, but he was awake, and\nunderstood and heard everything quite well.  Then she asked,\none slew none, what is that.  He replied, a raven, which\nate of a dead and poisoned horse, and died of it.  She\ninquired further, and yet slew twelve, what is that.  He\nanswered, that means twelve murderers, who ate the raven and died\nof it.\nWhen she knew the answer to the riddle she wanted to steal\naway, but he held her mantle so fast that she was forced to\nleave it behind her.  Next morning, the king's daughter\nannounced that she had guessed the riddle, and sent for the\ntwelve judges and expounded it before them.  But the youth\nbegged for a hearing, and said, she stole into my room in the\nnight and questioned me, otherwise she could not have\ndiscovered it.  The judges said, bring us a proof of this.\nThen were the three mantles brought thither by the servant,\nand when the judges saw the misty-grey one which the king's\ndaughter usually wore, they said, let the mantle be\nembroidered with gold and silver, and then it will be your\nwedding-mantle.\n"
