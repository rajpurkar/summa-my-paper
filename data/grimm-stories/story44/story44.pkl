S'A hermit lives his life carrying water to a high mountain. An angel goes with him each day and feeds the hermit when his work is finished. One day as he watches a criminal going to the gallows, the hermit thinks to himself that the man is getting his just punishment. From this time on the angel no longer brings food to the man. The hermit realizes God is angry with him. He finally discovers the reason for this anger is his judgment upon the man. Only God has the right to judge others.

S"There was once upon a time a hermit who lived in a forest at the\nfoot of a mountain, and passed his time in prayer and good works,\nand every evening he carried, to the glory of God, two pails of\nwater up the mountain.  Many a beast drank of it, and many a plant\nwas refreshed by it, for on the heights above, a strong wind blew\ncontinually, which dried the air and the ground, and the wild\nbirds which dread mankind wheel about there, and with their sharp\neyes search for a drink.  And because the hermit was so pious, an\nangel of God, visible to his eyes, went up with him, counted his\nsteps, and when the work was completed, brought him his food, even\nas the prophet of old was by God's command fed by the raven.  When\nthe hermit in his piety had already reached a great age, it\nhappened that he once saw from afar a poor sinner being taken to\nthe gallows.  He said carelessly to himself, there, that one is\ngetting his deserts.  In the evening, when he was carrying the\nwater up the mountain, the angel who usually accompanied him did\nnot appear, and also brought him no food.  Then he was terrified,\nand searched his heart, and tried to think how he could have\nsinned, as God was so angry, but he did not discover it.  Then\nhe neither ate nor drank, threw himself down on the ground, and\nprayed day and night.  And as he was one day thus bitterly\nweeping in the forest, he heard a little bird singing beautifully\nand delightfully, and then he was still more troubled and said,\nhow joyously you sing, the Lord is not angry with you.  Ah, if\nyou could but tell me how I can have offended him, that I might\ndo penance, and then my heart also would be glad again.  Then the\nbird began to speak and said, you have done injustice, in that\nyou have condemned a poor sinner who was being led to the gallows,\nand for that the Lord is angry with you.  He alone sits in\njudgement.  However, if you will do penance and repent your sins,\nhe will forgive you.  Then the angel stood beside him with a dry\nbranch in his hand and said, you shall carry this dry branch until\nthree green twigs sprout out of it, but at night when you will\nsleep, you shall lay it under your head.  You shall beg your\nbread from door to door, and not tarry more than one night in the\nsame house.  That is the penance which the Lord lays on you.\nThen the hermit took the piece of wood, and went back into the\nworld, which he had not seen for so long.  He ate and drank\nnothing but what was given him at the doors.  Many petitions,\nhowever, were not listened to, and many doors remained shut to\nhim, so that he often did not get a crumb of bread.\nOnce when he had gone from door to door from morning till night,\nand no one had given him anything, and no one would shelter him\nfor the night, he went forth into a forest, and at last found a\ncave which someone had made, and an old woman was sitting in it.\nThen said he, good woman, keep me with you in your house for\nthis night.  But she said, no, I dare not, even if I wished,\nI have three sons who are wicked and wild, if they come home\nfrom their robbing expedition, and find you, they would kill us\nboth.  The hermit said, let me stay, they will do no injury\neither to you or to me.  And the old woman was compassionate,\nand let herself be persuaded.  Then the man lay down beneath the\nstairs, and put the bit of wood under his head.  When the old\nwoman saw him do that, she asked the reason of it, on which he\ntold her that he carried the bit of wood about with him for a\npenance, and used it at night for a pillow, and that he had\noffended the Lord, because, when he had seen a poor sinner on\nthe way to the gallows, he had said he was getting his deserts.\nThen the woman began to weep and cried, if the Lord punishes one\nsingle word, how will it fare with my sons when they appear\nbefore him in judgment.\nAt midnight the robbers came home and blustered and stormed.\nThey made a fire, and when it had lighted up the cave and they\nsaw a man lying under the stairs, they fell in a rage and cried to\ntheir mother, who is the man.  Have we not forbidden anyone\nwhomsoever to be taken in.  Then said the mother, let him alone,\nit is a poor sinner who is expiating his crime.  The robbers\nasked, what has he done.  Old man, cried they, tell us your sins.\nThe old man raised himself and told them how he, by one single\nword, had so sinned that God was angry with him, and how he was\nnow expiating this crime.  The robbers were so powerfully touched\nin their hearts by this story, that they were shocked with their\nlife up to this time, reflected, and began with hearty\nrepentance to do penance for it.  The hermit, after he had\nconverted the three sinners, lay down to sleep again under the\nstairs.  In the morning, however, they found him dead, and out of\nthe dry wood on which his head lay, three green twigs had grown\nup on high.  Thus the Lord had once more received him into his\nfavor.\n"
