S'In olden times there lived an aged queen who was a sorceress, and her\ndaughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun.  The old woman,\nhowever, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to\ndestruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever\nwished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die.  Many\nhad been dazzled by the daughter\'s beauty, and had actually risked\nthis, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined\nthem to do, and then no mercy was shown, they had to kneel down, and\ntheir heads were struck off.\n\nA certain king\'s son who had also heard of the maiden\'s beauty, said\nto his father, "Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage."\n"Never," answered the king, "if you were to go, it would be going to\nyour death." On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and\nfor seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him. When\nthe father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he\nsaid to him, "Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other\nmeans of curing you." When the son heard that, he rose from his bed\nand was well again, and joyfully set out on his way.\n\nAnd it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from\nafar something like a great heap of hay laying on the ground, and\nwhen he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man,\nwho had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small\nmountain.  When the fat man saw the traveler, he stood up and said,\n"If you are in need of any one, take me into your service." The\nprince answered, "What can I do with such a clumsy man?" "Oh," said\nthe stout one, "this is nothing, when I really puff myself up, I am\nthree thousand times fatter." "If that\'s the case," said the prince,\n"I can make use of you, come with me."\n\nSo the stout one followed the prince, and after a while they found\nanother man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the\nturf.  "What are you doing there?" asked the king\'s son.  "I am\nlistening," replied the man.  "What are you listening to so\nattentively?" "I am listening to what is just going on in the world,\nfor nothing escapes my ears, I even hear the grass growing." "Tell\nme," said the prince, "what you hear at the court of the old queen\nwho has the beautiful daughter." Then he answered, "I hear the\nwhizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer\'s head." The\nking\'s son said, "I can make use of you, come with me."\n\nThey went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a\npair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body.  When they had\nwalked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to\nthe head also.  "Why," said the prince, "what a tall rascal you are."\n"Oh," replied the tall one, "that is nothing at all yet, when I\nreally stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and\ntaller than the highest mountain on earth.  I will gladly enter your\nservice, if you will take me." "Come with me," said the prince, "I\ncan make use of you."\n\nThey went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound\nup his eyes.  The prince said to him, "Have you weak eyes, that you\ncannot look at the light?" "No," replied the man, "but I must not\nremove the bandage, for whatsoever I look at with my eyes, splits to\npieces, so powerful is my glance.  If you can use that, I shall be\nglad to serve you." "Come with me," replied the king\'s son, "I can\nmake use of you."\n\nThey journeyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot\nsunshine, trembling and shivering all over his body, so that not a\nlimb was still.  "How can you shiver when the sun is shining so\nwarm?" said the king\'s son.  "Alas," replied the man, "I am of quite\na different nature.  The hotter it is, the colder I am, and the frost\npierces through all my bones, and the colder it is, the hotter I am.\nIn the midst of ice, I cannot endure the heat, nor in the midst of\nfire, the cold." "You are a strange fellow," said the prince, "but if\nyou will enter my service, follow me."\n\nThey traveled onwards, and saw a man standing who made a long neck\nand looked about him, and could see over all the mountains.  "What\nare you looking at so eagerly?" said the king\'s son.  The man\nreplied, "I have such sharp eyes that I can see into every forest and\nfield, and hill and valley, all over the world." The prince said,\n"Come with me if you will, for I am still in want of such an one."\n\nAnd now the king\'s son and his six servants came to the town where\nthe aged queen dwelt.  He did not tell her who he was, but said, "If\nyou will give me your beautiful daughter, I will perform any task you\nset me." The sorceress was delighted to get such a handsome youth as\nthis into her net, and said, "I will set you three tasks, and if you\nare able to perform them all, you shall be husband and master of my\ndaughter." "What is the first to be?" "You shall fetch me my ring\nwhich I have dropped into the red sea."\n\nSo the king\'s son went home to his servants and said, "The first task\nis not easy.  A ring is to be got out of the red sea.  Come, find\nsome way of doing it." Then the man with the sharp sight said, "I\nwill see where it is lying," and looked down into the water and said,\n"It is hanging there, on a pointed stone." The tall one carried them\nthither, and said, "I would soon get it out, if I could only see it."\n"Oh, is that all," cried the stout one, and lay down and put his\nmouth to the water, on which all the waves fell into it just as if it\nhad been a whirlpool, and he drank up the whole sea till it was as\ndry as a meadow.  The tall one stooped down a little, and brought out\nthe ring with his hand.\n\nThen the king\'s son rejoiced when he had the ring, and took it to the\nold queen.  She was astonished, and said, "Yes, it is the right ring.\nYou have safely performed the first task, but now comes the second.\nDo you see the meadow in front of my palace?  Three hundred fat oxen\nare feeding there, and these must you eat, skin, hair, bones, horns\nand all, and down below in my cellar lie three hundred casks of wine,\nand these you must drink up as well, and if one hair of the oxen, or\none little drop of the wine is left, your life will be forfeited to\nme." "May I invite no guests to this repast?" inquired the prince,\n"No dinner is good without some company." The old woman laughed\nmaliciously, and replied, "You may invite one for the sake of\ncompanionship, but no more."\n\nThe king\'s son went to his servants and said to the stout one, "You\nshall be my guest to-day, and shall eat your fill." Hereupon the\nstout one puffed himself up and ate the three hundred oxen without\nleaving one single hair, and then he asked if he was to have nothing\nbut his breakfast.  Then he drank the wine straight from the casks\nwithout feeling any need of a glass, and drained them down to their\ndregs.\n\nWhen the meal was over, the prince went to the old woman, and told\nher that the second task also was performed.  She wondered at this\nand said, "No one has ever done so much before, but one task still\nremains," and she thought to herself, "You shall not escape me, and\nwill not keep your head on your shoulders." "This night," said she,\n"I will bring my daughter to you in your chamber, and you shall put\nyour arms round her, but when you are sitting there together, beware\nof falling asleep.  When twelve o\'clock is striking, I will come, and\nif she is then no longer in your arms, you are lost."\n\nThe prince thought, "The task is easy, I will most certainly keep my\neyes open." Nevertheless he called his servants, told them what the\nold woman had said, and remarked, "Who knows what treachery lurks\nbehind this?  Foresight is a good thing - keep watch, and take\ncare that the maiden does not go out of my room again." When night\nfell, the old woman came with her daughter, and gave her into the\nprinces\'s arms, and then the tall one wound himself round the two in\na circle, and the stout one placed himself by the door, so that no\nliving creature could enter.  There the two sat, and the maiden spoke\nnever a word, but the moon shone through the window on her face, and\nthe prince could behold her wondrous beauty.  He did nothing but gaze\nat her, and was filled with love and happiness, and his eyes never\nfelt weary.  This lasted until eleven o\'clock, when the old woman\ncast such a spell over all of them that they fell asleep, and at the\nself-same moment the maiden was carried away.\n\nThen they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve, when the magic\nlost its power, and all awoke again.  "Oh, misery and misfortune,"\ncried the prince, "now I am lost." The faithful servants also began\nto lament, but the listener said, "Be quiet, I want to listen." Then\nhe listened for an instant and said, "She is on a rock, three hundred\nleagues from hence, bewailing her fate.  You alone, tall one, can\nhelp her, if you will stand up, you will be there in a couple of\nsteps."\n\n"Yes," answered the tall one, "but the one with the sharp eyes must\ngo with me, that we may destroy the rock." Then the tall one took the\none with bandaged eyes on his back, and in the twinkling of an eye\nthey were on the enchanted rock.  The tall one immediately took the\nbandage from the other\'s eyes, and he did but look round, and the\nrock shivered into a thousand pieces. Then the tall one took the\nmaiden in his arms, carried her back in a second, then fetched his\ncompanion with the same rapidity, and before it struck twelve they\nwere all sitting as they had sat before, quite merrily and happily.\nWhen twelve struck, the aged sorceress came stealing in with a\nmalicious face, as much as to say, "Now he is mine, for she believed\nthat her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off." But\nwhen she saw her in the prince\'s arms, she was alarmed, and said,\n"Here is one who knows more than I do." She dared not make any\nopposition, and was forced to give him her daughter.  But she\nwhispered in her ear, "It is a disgrace to you to have to obey common\npeople, and that you are not allowed to choose a husband to your own\nliking."\n\nOn this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger, and she\nmeditated revenge.  Next morning she caused three hundred great\nbundles of wood to be got together, and said to the prince that\nthough the three tasks were performed, she would still not be his\nwife until someone was ready to seat himself in the midst of the\nwood, and bear the fire.  She thought that none of his servants would\nlet themselves be burnt for him, and that out of love for her, he\nhimself would place himself upon it, and then she would be free.  But\nthe servants said, "Every one of us has done something except the\nfrosty one, he must set to work, and they put him in the middle of\nthe pile, and set fire to it." Then the fire began to burn, and burnt\nfor three days until all the wood was consumed, and when the flames\nhad burnt out, the frosty one was standing amid the ashes, trembling\nlike an aspen leaf, and saying, "I never felt such a frost during the\nwhole course of my life, if it had lasted much longer, I should have\nbeen benumbed."\n\nAs no other pretext was to be found, the beautiful maiden was now\nforced to take the unknown youth as a husband.  But when they drove\naway to church, the old woman said, "I cannot endure the disgrace,"\nand sent her warriors after them with orders to cut down all who\nopposed them, and bring back her daughter.  But the listener had\nsharpened his ears, and heard the secret discourse of the old woman.\n"What shall we do?" said he to the stout one.  But he knew what to\ndo, and spat out once or twice behind the carriage some of the\nsea-water which he had drunk, and a great lake arose in which the\nwarriors were caught and drowned.\n\nWhen the sorceress perceived that, she sent her mailed knights, but\nthe listener heard the rattling of their armor, and undid the bandage\nfrom one eye of sharp-eyes, who looked for a while rather fixedly at\nthe enemy\'s troops, on which they all sprang to pieces like glass.\nThen the youth and the maiden went on their way undisturbed, and when\nthe two had been blessed in church, the six servants took leave, and\nsaid to their master, "Your wishes are now satisfied, you need us no\nlonger, we will go our way and seek our fortunes."\n\nHalf a league from the palace of the prince\'s father was a village\nnear which a swineherd tended his herd, and when they came thither\nthe prince said to his wife, "Do you know who I really am?  I am no\nprince, but a herder of swine, and the man who is there with that\nherd, is my father.  We two shall have to set to work also, and help\nhim." Then he alighted with her at the inn, and secretly told the\ninnkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night.  So when\nshe awoke in the morning, she had nothing to put on, and the\ninnkeeper\'s wife gave her an old gown and a pair of worsted\nstockings, and at the same time seemed to consider it a great\npresent, and said, "If it were not for the sake of your husband I\nshould have given you nothing at all." Then the princess believed\nthat he really was a swineherd, and tended the herd with him, and\nthought to herself, "I have deserved this for my haughtiness and\npride."\n\nThis lasted for a week, and then she could endure it no longer, for\nshe had sores on her feet.  And now came a couple of people who asked\nif she knew who her husband was.  "Yes," she answered, "he is a\nswineherd, and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive\na little bargain." But they said, "Just come with us, and we will\ntake you to him," and they took her up to the palace, and when she\nentered the hall, there stood her husband in kingly raiment.  But she\ndid not recognize him until he took her in his arms, kissed her, and\nsaid, "I suffered so much for you that you, too, had to suffer for\nme." And then the wedding was celebrated, and he who has related\nthis, wishes that he, too, had been present at it.\n'
