A magician has a rooster that carries a heavy beam. A girl sees that the beam is only a straw. She ridicules the man and the crowd drives him away in disgrace. The magician decides to get revenge on the girl on her wedding day. As she goes to the church, she reaches a swollen creek and lifts her dress so she can wade across. The magician has enchanted the creek and it is really only a field of blue flowers the girl walks across with her lifted dress. All the townspeople ridicule the girl and chase her away.
