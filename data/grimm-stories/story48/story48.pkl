S"Three princes wish to cure their father by bringing him a drink of the water of life. On their quest for the water, the two oldest sons are mean to a dwarf who bewitches them so that they become stuck between two mountains. The youngest son is kind to the dwarf, and the dwarf tells him where to find the water of life. The youngest son does as the dwarf instructs and takes with him a cupful of the water, a sword with which he can kill many armies of men, and a loaf of bread that is never depleted. He also finds a maiden who says she will marry him in one year's time. "

S'There was once a king who had an illness, and no one believed that he\nwould come out of it with his life.  He had three sons who were much\ndistressed about it, and went down into the palace-garden and wept.\nThere they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their\ngrief.  They told him that their father was so ill that he would most\ncertainly die, for nothing seemed to cure him.  Then the old man\nsaid, "I know of one more remedy, and that is the water of life.  If\nhe drinks of it he will become well again, but it is hard to find."\nThe eldest said, "I will manage to find it." And went to the sick\nking, and begged to be allowed to go forth in search of the water of\nlife, for that alone could save him.  "No," said the king, "the\ndanger of it is too great.  I would rather die."\n\nBut he begged so long that the king consented.  The prince thought in\nhis heart, "If I bring the water, then I shall be best beloved of my\nfather, and shall inherit the kingdom." So he set out, and when he\nhad ridden forth a little distance, a dwarf stood there in the road\nwho called to him and said, "Whither away so fast?" "Silly shrimp,"\nsaid the prince, very haughtily, "it is nothing to do with you." And\nrode on.  But the little dwarf had grown angry, and had wished an\nevil wish.  Soon after this the prince entered a ravine, and the\nfurther he rode the closer the mountains drew together, and at last\nthe road became so narrow that he could not advance a step further.\nIt was impossible either to turn his horse or to dismount from the\nsaddle, and he was shut in there as if in prison.  The sick king\nwaited long for him, but he came not.\n\nThen the second son said, "father, let me go forth to seek the\nwater." And thought to himself, "If my brother is dead, then the\nkingdom will fall to me." At first the king would not allow him to go\neither, but at last he yielded, so the prince set out on the same\nroad that his brother had taken, and he too met the dwarf, who\nstopped him to ask whither he was going in such haste.  "Little\nshrimp," said the prince, "that is nothing to do with you." And rode\non without giving him another look.  But the dwarf bewitched him, and\nhe, like the other, rode into a ravine, and could neither go forwards\nnor backwards.  So fare haughty people.\n\nAs the second son also remained away, the youngest begged to be\nallowed to go forth to fetch the water, and at last the king was\nobliged to let him go.  When he met the dwarf and the latter asked\nhim whither he was going in such haste, he stopped, gave him an\nexplanation, and said, "I am seeking the water of life, for my father\nis sick unto death."\n\n"Do you know, then, where that is to be found?"\n\n"No," said the prince.\n\n"As you have borne yourself as is seemly, and not haughtily like your\nfalse brothers, I will give you the information and tell you how you\nmay obtain the water of life.  It springs from a fountain in the\ncourtyard of an enchanted castle, but you will not be able to make\nyour way to it, if I do not give you an iron wand and two small\nloaves of bread.  Strike thrice with the wand on the iron door of the\ncastle and it will spring open, inside lie two lions with gaping\njaws, but if you throw a loaf to each of them, they will be quieted.\nThen hasten to fetch some of the water of life before the clock\nstrikes twelve else the door will shut again, and you will be\nimprisoned."\n\nThe prince thanked him, took the wand and the bread, and set out on\nhis way.  When he arrived, everything was as the dwarf had said.  The\ndoor sprang open at the third stroke of the wand, and when he had\nappeased the lions with the bread, he entered the castle, and came to\na large and splendid hall, wherein sat some enchanted princes whose\nrings he drew off their fingers.  A sword and a loaf of bread were\nlying there, which he carried away.  After this, he entered a\nchamber, in which was a beautiful maiden who rejoiced when she saw\nhim, kissed him, and told him that he had set her free, and should\nhave the whole of her kingdom, and that if he would return in a year\ntheir wedding should be celebrated.  Likewise she told him where the\nspring of the water of life was, and that he was to hasten and draw\nsome of it before the clock struck twelve.  Then he went onwards, and\nat last entered a room where there was a beautiful newly-made bed,\nand as he was very weary, he felt inclined to rest a little.  So he\nlay down and fell asleep.\n\nWhen he awoke, it was striking a quarter to twelve.  He sprang up in\na fright, ran to the spring, drew some water in a cup which stood\nnear, and hastened away.  But just as he was passing through the iron\ndoor, the clock struck twelve, and the door fell to with such\nviolence that it carried away a piece of his heel.\n\nHe, however, rejoicing at having obtained the water of life, went\nhomewards, and again passed the dwarf.  When the latter saw the sword\nand the loaf, he said, "With these you have won great wealth, with\nthe sword you can slay whole armies, and the bread will never come to\nan end." But the prince would not go home to his father without his\nbrothers, and said, "Dear dwarf, can you not tell me where my two\nbrothers are?  They went out before I did in search of the water of\nlife, and have not returned."\n\n"They are imprisoned between two mountains," said the dwarf. "I have\ncondemned them to stay there, because they were so haughty." Then the\nprince begged until the dwarf released them, but he warned him and\nsaid, "Beware of them, for they have bad hearts." When his brothers\ncame, he rejoiced, and told them how things had gone with him, that\nhe had found the water of life and had brought a cupful away with\nhim, and had rescued a beautiful princess, who was willing to wait a\nyear for him, and then their wedding was to be celebrated and he\nwould obtain a great kingdom.\n\nAfter that they rode on together, and chanced upon a land where war\nand famine reigned, and the king already thought he must perish, for\nthe scarcity was so great.  Then the prince went to him and gave him\nthe loaf, wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom,\nand then the prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the\nhosts of his enemies, and could now live in rest and peace.  The\nprince then took back his loaf and his sword, and the three brothers\nrode on.  But after this they entered two more countries where war\nand famine reigned and each time the prince gave his loaf and his\nsword to the kings, and had now delivered three kingdoms, and after\nthat they went on board a ship and sailed over the sea.  During the\npassage, the two eldest conversed apart and said, "The youngest has\nfound the water of life and not we, for that our father will give him\nthe kingdom - the kingdom which belongs to us, and he will rob us of\nall our fortune." They then began to seek revenge, and plotted with\neach other to destroy him.  They waited until they found him fast\nasleep, then they poured the water of life out of the cup, and took\nit for themselves, but into the cup they poured salt sea-water.\n\nNow therefore, when they arrived home, the youngest took his cup to\nthe sick king in order that he might drink out of it, and be cured.\nBut scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he\nbecame still worse than before.  And as he was lamenting over this,\nthe two eldest brothers came, and accused the youngest of having\nintended to poison him, and said that they had brought him the true\nwater of life, and handed it to him.  He had scarcely tasted it, when\nhe felt his sickness departing, and became strong and healthy as in\nthe days of his youth.\n\nAfter that they both went to the youngest, mocked him, and said, "You\ncertainly found the water of life, but you have had the pain, and we\nthe gain, you should have been cleverer, and should have kept your\neyes open.  We took it from you whilst you were asleep at sea, and\nwhen a year is over, one of us will go and fetch the beautiful\nprincess. But beware that you do not disclose aught of this to our\nfather, indeed he does not trust you, and if you say a single word,\nyou shall lose your life into the bargain, but if you keep silent,\nyou shall have it as a gift."\n\nThe old king was angry with his youngest son, and thought he had\nplotted against his life.  So he summoned the court together and had\nsentence pronounced upon his son, that he should be secretly shot.\nAnd once when the prince was riding forth to the chase, suspecting no\nevil, the king\'s huntsman was told to go with him, and when they were\nquite alone in the forest, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the\nprince said to him, "Dear huntsman, what ails you?" The huntsman\nsaid, "I cannot tell you, and yet I ought." Then the prince said,\n"Say openly what it is, I will pardon you." "Alas," said the\nhuntsman, "I am to shoot you dead, the king has ordered me to do it."\nThen the prince was shocked, and said, "Dear huntsman, let me live,\nthere, I give you my royal garments, give me your common ones in\ntheir stead." The huntsman said, "I will willingly do that, indeed I\nwould not have been able to shoot you." Then they exchanged clothes,\nand the huntsman returned home, while the prince went further into\nthe forest.\n\nAfter a time three waggons of gold and precious stones came to the\nking for his youngest son, which were sent by the three kings who had\nslain their enemies with the prince\'s sword, and maintained their\npeople with his bread, and who wished to show their gratitude for it.\nThe old king then thought, "Can my son have been innocent?" And said\nto his people, "Would that he were still alive, how it grieves me\nthat I have suffered him to be killed." "He still lives," said the\nhuntsman, "I could not find it in my heart to carry out your\ncommand." And told the king how it had happened.  Then a stone fell\nfrom the king\'s heart, and he had it proclaimed in every country that\nhis son might return and be taken into favor again.\n\nThe princess, however, had a road made up to her palace which was\nquite bright and golden, and told her people that whosoever came\nriding straight along it to her, would be the right one and was to be\nadmitted, and whoever rode by the side of it, was not the right one\nand was not to be admitted.\n\nAs the time was now close at hand, the eldest thought he would hasten\nto go to the king\'s daughter, and give himself out as her rescuer,\nand thus win her for his bride, and the kingdom to boot.  Therefore\nhe rode forth, and when he arrived in front of the palace, and saw\nthe splendid golden road, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame\nif I were to ride over that.  And turned aside, and rode on the right\nside of it. But when he came to the door, the servants told him that\nhe was not the right one, and was to go away again.\n\nSoon after this the second prince set out, and when he came to the\ngolden road, and his horse had put one foot on it, he thought, it\nwould be a sin and a shame, a piece might be trodden off.  And he\nturned aside and rode on the left side of it, and when he reached the\ndoor, the attendants told him he was not the right one, and he was to\ngo away again.\n\nWhen at last the year had entirely expired, the third son likewise\nwished to ride out of the forest to his beloved, and with her forget\nhis sorrows.  So he set out and thought of her so incessantly, and\nwished to be with her so much, that he never noticed the golden road\nat all.  So his horse rode onwards up the middle of it, and when he\ncame to the door, it was opened and the princess received him with\njoy, and said he was her saviour, and lord of the kingdom, and their\nwedding was celebrated with great rejoicing.  When it was over she\ntold him that his father invited him to come to him, and had forgiven\nhim.\n\nSo he rode thither, and told him everything, how his brothers had\nbetrayed him, and how he had nevertheless kept silence.  The old king\nwished to punish them, but they had put to sea, and never came back\nas long as they lived.\n'
