Three princes wish to cure their father by bringing him a drink of the water of life. On their quest for the water, the two oldest sons are mean to a dwarf who bewitches them so that they become stuck between two mountains. The youngest son is kind to the dwarf, and the dwarf tells him where to find the water of life. The youngest son does as the dwarf instructs and takes with him a cupful of the water, a sword with which he can kill many armies of men, and a loaf of bread that is never depleted. He also finds a maiden who says she will marry him in one year's time.
