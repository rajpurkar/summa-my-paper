S'A man gives each of his three sons an items with which he hopes they will be able to earn their fortunes. The eldest receives a cock, the middle a scythe, and the youngest a cat. Each discovers that on the main land their items are not unusual. When they travel to an island their items are unusual. The people there pay great amounts of money for them. The people who buy the cat become fearful when they hear the cat meow and fear that she plans to attack them. They abandon the palace where the cat is and shoot cannons at the palace in an attempt to kill the beast. The cat escapes the attack, but the entire palace is destroyed. '

S'A father once called his three sons before him, and he gave to the\nfirst a cock, to the second a scythe, and to the third a cat.  I am\nalready aged, said he, my death is nigh, and I have wished to provide\nfor you before my end, money I have not, and what I now give you\nseems of little worth, but all depends on your making a sensible use\nof it.  Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown,\nand your fortune is made.\n\nAfter the father\'s death the eldest went away with his cock, but\nwherever he came the cock was already known, in the towns he saw him\nfrom a long distance, sitting upon the steeples and turning round\nwith the wind, and in the villages he heard more than one crowing, no\none would show any wonder at the creature, so that it did not look as\nif he would make his fortune by it.\n\nAt last, however, it happened that he came to an island where the\npeople knew nothing about cocks, and did not even understand how to\ndivide their time.  They certainly knew when it was morning or\nevening, but at night, if they did not sleep through it, not one of\nthem knew how to find out the time.\n\nLook. Said he, what a proud creature.  It has a ruby-red crown upon\nits head, and wears spurs like a knight, it calls you three times\nduring the night, at fixed hours, and when it calls for the last\ntime, the sun soon rises.  But if it crows by broad daylight, then\ntake notice, for there will certainly be a change of weather.\n\nThe people were well pleased, for a whole night they did not sleep,\nand listened with great delight as the cock at two, four, and six\no\'clock, loudly and clearly proclaimed the time.  They asked if the\ncreature were for sale, and how much he wanted for it.  About as much\ngold as an ass can carry, answered he.  A ridiculously small price\nfor such a precious creature. They cried unanimously, and willingly\ngave him what he had asked.\n\nWhen he came home with his wealth his brothers were astonished, and\nthe second said, well, I will go forth and see whether I cannot get\nrid of my scythe as profitably.  But it did not look as if he would,\nfor laborers met him everywhere, and they had scythes upon their\nshoulders as well as he.\n\nAt last, however, he chanced upon an island where the people knew\nnothing of scythes.  When the corn was ripe there, they took cannon\nout to the fields and shot it down.  Now this was rather an uncertain\naffair, many shot right over it, others hit the ears instead of the\nstems, and shot them away, whereby much was lost, and besides all\nthis, it made a terrible noise.  So the man set to work and mowed it\ndown so quietly and quickly that the people opened their mouths with\nastonishment.  They agreed to give him what he wanted for the scythe,\nand he received a horse laden with as much gold as it could carry.\n\nAnd now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man. He\nfared just like the others, so long as he stayed on the mainland\nthere was nothing to be done.  Every place had cats, and there were\nso many of them that new-born kittens were generally drowned in the\nponds.\n\nAt last he sailed over to an island, and it luckily happened that no\ncats had ever yet been seen there, and that the mice had got the\nupper hand so much that they danced upon the tables and benches\nwhether the master were at home or not.  The people complained\nbitterly of the plague, the king himself in his palace did not know\nhow to protect himself against them, mice squeaked in every corner,\nand gnawed whatever they could lay hold of with their teeth.\n\nBut now the cat began her chase, and soon cleared a couple of rooms,\nand the people begged the king to buy the wonderful beast for the\ncountry.  The king willingly gave what was asked, which was a mule\nladen with gold, and the third brother came home with the greatest\ntreasure of all.\n\nThe cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace, and\nkilled so many that they could not be counted.  At last she grew warm\nwith the work and thirsty, so she stood still, lifted up her head and\ncried, mew. Mew.\n\nWhen they heard this strange cry, the king and all his people were\nfrightened, and in their terror ran all at once out of the palace.\nThen the king took counsel what was best to be done, at last it was\ndetermined to send a herald to the cat, and demand that she should\nleave the palace, or if not, she was to expect that force would be\nused against her.  The councillors said, rather will we let ourselves\nbe plagued with the mice, for to that misfortune we are accustomed,\nthan give up our lives to such a monster as this.  A noble youth,\ntherefore, was sent to ask the cat whether she would peaceably quit\nthe castle.  But the cat, whose thirst had become still greater,\nmerely answered, mew. Mew.  The youth understood her to say, "Most\ncertainly not. Most certainly not." And took this answer to the king.\n\nThen, said the councillors, she shall yield to force. Cannon were\nbrought out, and the palace was soon in flames.  When the fire\nreached the room where the cat was sitting, she sprang safely out of\nthe window, but the besiegers did not leave off until the whole\npalace was shot down to the ground.\n'
