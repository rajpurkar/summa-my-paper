A peasant sees a doctor's richness and desires it for himself. He is told that all he has to do to be a doctor is buy an A B C book, trade his wagon and oxen for money, and nail a sign to his door that reads "Doctor Knowall". A great lord calls for the doctor to solve the mystery of his stolen money. Through luck, the doctor is able to solve the mystery.
