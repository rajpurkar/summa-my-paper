S"While visiting the earth, the Lord looks for a place to spend the night. A rich man turns Him away. The poor couple across the street welcomes Him, feeds Him, and lets Him sleep in their bed. Before He leaves, the Lord gives the poor man three wishes. The poor man wishes for health and happiness, and daily bread. Not knowing what else to wish for, the Lord suggests the man wish for a new house. When the rich man and his wife see their poor neighbor's new house, the poor man's wife asks the man to chase the Lord down and ask for three wishes also. The Lord does so, but indicates his wishes will not go well for him. As the man tries to decide what he will wish for, his horse begins..."

S"In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on\nthis earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and\novertaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn.  Now\nthere stood on the road before him two houses facing each other,\nthe one large and beautiful, the other small and poor.  The\nlarge one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor\nman.\nThen the Lord thought, I shall be no burden to the rich man.\nI will stay the night with him.  Then the rich man heard someone\nknocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger\nwhat he wanted.  The Lord answered, I only ask for a night's\nlodging.\nThen the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and\nas the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like\none who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and\nsaid, no, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and\nseeds.  And if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door,\nI might very soon go begging myself.  Go somewhere else for\na lodging, and with this he shut down the window and left the\nLord standing there.\nSo the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across\nto the small house and knocked.  He had hardly done so when\nthe poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler\ncome in.  Pass the night with me, it is already dark, said he.\nYou cannot go any further to-night.  This pleased the Lord,\nand he went in.  The poor man's wife shook hands with him,\nand welcomed him, and said he\nwas to make himself at home and put up with what they had got.\nThey had not much to offer him, but what they had they would\ngive him with all their hearts.  Then she put the potatoes on\nthe fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat,\nthat they might have a little milk with them.  When the\ncloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife,\nand he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces\nat the table.  When they had had supper and it was bed-time,\nthe woman called her husband apart and said, listen, dear\nhusband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night,\nand then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a\ngood rest, for he has been walking the whole day through,\nand that makes one weary.  With all my heart, he answered,\nI will go and offer it to him.  And he went to the stranger\nand invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their\nbed and rest his limbs properly.  But the Lord was unwilling\nto take their bed from the two old folks.  However, they\nwould not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay\ndown in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw\non the ground.\nNext morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a\nbreakfast as they could for the guest.  When the sun shone in\nthrough the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again\nate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey.\nBut as he was standing at the door he turned round and said,\nas you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for\nyourselves and I will grant them.  Then the man said, what\nelse should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we\ntwo, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day\nour daily bread.  For the third wish, I do not know what to\nhave.  And the Lord said to him, will you wish for a new\nhouse instead of this old one.  Oh, yes, said the man.\nIf I can have that, too, I should like it very much.  And\nthe Lord fulfilled his wish, and changed their old house\ninto a new one, again gave them his blessing, and went on.\nThe sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out\nof his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a\nnew clean-looking\nhouse with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut\nused to be.  He was very much astonished, and called his\nwife and said to her, tell me, what can have happened.\nLast night there was a miserable little hut standing there,\nand to-day there is a beautiful new house.  Run over and see\nhow that has come to pass.\nSo his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her,\nyesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a\nnight's lodging, and this morning when he took leave of\nus he granted us three wishes - eternal happiness, health\nduring this life and our daily bread as well, and\nbesides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old\nhut.\nWhen the rich man's wife heard this, she ran back in haste\nand told her husband how it had happened.  The man said,\nI could tear myself to pieces.  If I had but known that.\nThat traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep\nhere, and I sent him away.  Quick, said his wife, get on\nyour horse.  You can still catch the man up, and then you must\nask to have three wishes granted to you also.\nThe rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on\nhis horse, and soon came up with the Lord.  He spoke to him\nsoftly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it\namiss that he had not let him in directly.  He was looking\nfor the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had\ngone away.  If he returned the same way he must come and\nstay with him.  Yes, said the Lord.  If I ever come back\nagain, I will do so.  Then the rich man asked if might not\nwish for three things too, as his neighbor had done.\nYes, said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his\nadvantage, and he had better not wish for anything.  But\nthe rich man thought that he could easily ask for something\nwhich would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would\nbe granted.  So the Lord said to him, ride home, then, and\nthree wishes which you shall make, shall be fulfilled.\nThe rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home,\nand began to consider what he should wish for.  As he\nwas thus\nthinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper\nabout, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations,\nand could not collect his thoughts at all.  He patted its neck,\nand said, gently, lisa, but the horse only began new tricks.\nThen at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, I wish\nyour neck was broken.  Directly he had said the words, down the\nhorse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never\nmoved again.  And thus was his first wish fulfilled.  As he\nwas miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness\nlying there.  So he cut it off, and put it on his back.  And\nnow he had to go on foot.  I have still two wishes left, said\nhe, and comforted himself with that thought.\nAnd now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the\nsun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite bad-tempered\nand angry.  The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any\nidea what to wish for.  If I were to wish for all the riches\nand treasures in the world, said he to himself, I should still\nto think of all kinds of other things later on.  I know that,\nbeforehand.  But I will manage so that there is nothing at all\nleft me to wish for afterwards.  Then he sighed and said, ah,\nif I were but that bavarian peasant, who likewise had three\nwishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and\nin the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in\nthe second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in\nthe third for a barrel of beer into the bargain.\nMany a time he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to\nhim to be, after all, too little.  Then it came into his\nmind, what an easy life his wife had, for she stayed at\nhome in a cool room and enjoyed herself.  This really did vex\nhim, and before he was aware, he said, I just wish she was\nsitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it,\ninstead of my having to drag it along on my back.  And as the\nlast word was spoken, the saddle disappeared from his back,\nand he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled.  Then\nhe really did feel hot.  He began to run and wanted to be quite\nalone in his own room at home, to think of something really\nbig for his last wish.  But when he arrived there and opened\nthe parlor-door, he\nsaw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle,\ncrying and complaining, and quite unable to get off it.  So\nhe said, do bear it, and I will wish for all the riches on\nearth for you, only stay where you are.  She, however, called\nhim a fool, and said, what good will all the riches on earth\ndo me, if I am to sit on this saddle.  You have wished me\non it, so you must help me off.  So whether he would or not,\nhe was forced to let his third wish be that she should be\nquit of the saddle, and able to get off it, and immediately\nthe wish was fulfilled.  So he got nothing by it but vexation,\ntrouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse.  But the poor\npeople lived contentedly, quietly, and piously until their\nhappy death.\n"
