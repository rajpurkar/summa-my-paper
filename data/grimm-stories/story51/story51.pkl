S"Because they are embarrassed by their father's inability to eat without making a mess, the man's son and his wife make the man sit behind the stove to eat. The young grandson builds something with a few pieces of wood. The parents ask what it is and he tells them it is a trough for them to eat out of when they grow old. Learning their lesson, they allow the grandfather to eat at the table again."

S"There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears\ndull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he\ncould hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth\nor let it run out of his mouth.  His son and his son's wife were\ndisgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the\ncorner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware\nbowl, and not even enough of it.  And he used to look towards the\ntable with his eyes full of tears.\n\nOnce, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell\nto the ground and broke.  The young wife scolded him, but he said\nnothing and only sighed.  Then they bought him a wooden bowl for a\nfew half-pence, out of which he had to eat.\n\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years\nold began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground.  What\nare you doing there, asked the father.  I am making a little trough,\nanswered the child, for father and mother to eat out of when I am\nbig.\n\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\nbegan to cry.  Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if\nhe did spill a little of anything.\n"
