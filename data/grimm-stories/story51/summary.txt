Because they are embarrassed by their father's inability to eat without making a mess, the man's son and his wife make the man sit behind the stove to eat. The young grandson builds something with a few pieces of wood. The parents ask what it is and he tells them it is a trough for them to eat out of when they grow old. Learning their lesson, they allow the grandfather to eat at the table again.
