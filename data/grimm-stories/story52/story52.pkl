S"There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage.  In\nfront of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees,\none of which bore white and the other red roses.  She had two\nchildren who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called\nsnow-white, and the other rose-red.  They were as good and happy,\nas busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only\nsnow-white was more quiet and gentle than rose-red.  Rose-red\nliked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking\nflowers and catching butterflies, but snow-white sat at home\nwith her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to\nher when there was nothing to do.\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always\nheld each other by the hand when they went out together, and\nwhen snow-white said, we will not leave each other, rose-red\nanswered, never so long as we live, and their mother would\nadd, what one has she must share with the other.\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries,\nand no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them\ntrustfully.  The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of\ntheir hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt\nmerrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and\nsang whatever they knew.\nNo mishap overtook them, if they had stayed too late in the\nforest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one\nanother upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their\nmother knew this and did not worry on their account.\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn\nhad roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white\ndress sitting near their bed.  He got up and looked quite kindly\nat them, but said nothing and went away into the forest.  And\nwhen they looked round they found that they had been sleeping\nquite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into\nit in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further.\nAnd their mother told them that it must have been the angel who\nwatches over good children.\nSnow-white and rose-red kept their mother's little cottage so\nneat that it was a pleasure to look inside it.  In the summer\nrose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath\nof flowers by her mother's bed before she awoke, in which was\na rose from each tree.  In the winter snow-white lit the fire and\nhung the kettle on the hob.  The kettle was of brass and shone\nlike gold, so brightly was it polished.  In the evening, when\nthe snowflakes fell, the mother said, go, snow-white, and bolt\nthe door, and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother\ntook her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the\ntwo girls listened as they sat and spun.  And close by them lay\na lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white\ndove with its head hidden beneath its wings.\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together,\nsomeone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in.  The\nmother said, quick, rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveler\nwho is seeking shelter.  Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt,\nthinking that it was a poor man, but it was not.  It was a\nbear that stretched his broad, black head within the door.\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove\nfluttered, and snow-white hid herself behind her mother's bed.\nBut the bear began to speak and said, do not be afraid, I will\ndo you no harm.  I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself\na little beside you.\nPoor bear, said the mother, lie down by the fire, only take\ncare that you do not burn your coat.  Then she cried, snow-white,\nrose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\nSo they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came\nnearer, and were not afraid of him.  The bear said, here,\nchildren, knock the snow out of my coat a little.  So they\nbrought the broom and swept the bear's hide clean, and he\nstretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\ncomfortably.  It was not long before they grew quite at home,\nand played tricks with their clumsy guest.  They tugged his\nhair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled\nhim about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he\ngrowled they laughed.  But the bear took it all in good part, only\nwhen they were too rough he called out, leave me alive, children,\n               snow-white, rose-red,\n               will you beat your wooer dead.\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother\nsaid to the bear, you can lie there by the hearth, and then you\nwill be safe from the cold and the bad weather.  As soon as day\ndawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across\nthe snow into the forest.\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid\nhimself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves\nwith him as much as they liked.  And they got so used to him that\nthe doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived.\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said\none morning to snow-white, now I must go away, and cannot come\nback for the whole summer.  Where are you going, then, dear bear,\nasked snow-white.  I must go into the forest and guard my treasures\nfrom the wicked dwarfs.  In the winter, when the earth is frozen\nhard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their\nway through, but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the\nearth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal.  And\nwhat once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not\neasily see daylight again.\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted\nthe door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against\nthe bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it\nseemed to snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through\nit, but she was not sure about it.  The bear ran away quickly,\nand was soon out of sight behind the trees.\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the\nforest to get fire-wood.  There they found a big tree which lay\nfelled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was\njumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could\nnot make out what it was.  When they came nearer they saw a dwarf\nwith an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long.  The\nend of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the\nlittle fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did\nnot know what to do.\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried, why do\nyou stand there.  Can you not come here and help me.  What are\nyou up to, little man, asked rose-red.  You stupid, prying\ngoose, answered the dwarf.  I was going to split the tree to get\na little wood for cooking.  The little bit of food that we people\nget is immediately burnt up with heavy logs.  We do not swallow\nso much as you coarse, greedy folk.  I had just driven the\nwedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished, but the\ncursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree\nclosed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white\nbeard, so now it is tight in and I cannot get away, and the silly,\nsleek, milk-faced things laugh.  Ugh.  How odious you are.\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the\nbeard out, it was caught too fast.  I will run and fetch someone,\nsaid rose-red.  You senseless goose, snarled the dwarf.  Why\nshould you fetch someone.  You are already two too many for me.\nCan you not think of something better.  Don't be impatient, said\nsnow-white, I will help you, and she pulled her scissors out of\nher pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which\nlay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold,\nand lifted it up, grumbling to himself, uncouth people, to cut\noff a\npiece of my fine beard.  Bad luck to you, and then he swung the\nbag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at\nthe children.\nSome time afterwards snow-white and rose-red went to catch a\ndish of fish.  As they came near the brook they saw something\nlike a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if\nit were going to leap in.  They ran to it and found it was the\ndwarf.  Where are you going, said rose-red, you surely don't\nwant to go into the water.  I am not such a fool, cried the\ndwarf.  Don't you see that the accursed fish wants to pull\nme in.  The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line.\nA moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble\ncreature had not strength to pull it out.  The fish kept the\nupper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him.  He held on to\nall the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, for he\nwas forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in\nurgent danger of being dragged into the water.\nThe girls came just in time.  They held him fast and tried to\nfree his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line\nwere entangled fast together.  There was nothing to do but to\nbring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part\nof it was lost.  When the dwarf saw that he screamed out,\nis that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man's face.  Was\nit not enough to clip off the end of my beard.  Now you have\ncut off the best part of it.  I cannot let myself be seen by\nmy people.  I wish you had been made to run the soles off your\nshoes.  Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the\nrushes, and without another word he dragged it away and\ndisappeared behind a stone.\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children\nto the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons.  The\nroad led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay\nstrewn about.  There they noticed a large bird hovering in the\nair, flying slowly round and round above them.  It sank lower and\nlower, and at last settled near a rock not far away.  Immediately\nthey heard a loud, piteous cry.  They ran up and saw with horror\nthat the\neagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going\nto carry him off.\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little\nman, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let\nhis booty go.  As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his\nfirst fright he cried with his shrill voice, could you not have\ndone it more carefully.  You dragged at my brown coat so that it\nis all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures.  Then he\ntook up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again\nunder the rock into his hole.  The girls, who by this time\nwere used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their\nbusiness in the town.\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised\nthe dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in\na clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there\nso late.  The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones.\nThey glittered and sparkled with all colors so beautifully that\nthe children stood still and stared at them.  Why do you stand\ngaping there, cried the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became\ncopper-red with rage.  He was still cursing when a loud\ngrowling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them\nout of the forest.  The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he\ncould not reach his cave, for the bear was already close.  Then\nin the dread of his heart he cried, dear mr. Bear, spare me, I\nwill give you all my treasures, look, the beautiful jewels\nlying there. Grant me my life.  What do you want with such a\nslender little fellow as I.  You would not feel me between\nyour teeth.  Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender\nmorsels for you, fat as young quails, for mercy's sake eat them.\nThe bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature\na single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them, snow-white\nand rose-red, do not be afraid.  Wait, I will come with you.\nThen they recognised his voice and waited, and when he came up\nto them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there,\na handsome man, clothed all in gold.  I am a king's son, he said,\nand I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my\ntreasures.\nI have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was\nfreed by his death.  Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.\nSnow-white was married to him, and rose-red to his brother,\nand they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf\nhad gathered together in his cave.  The old mother lived\npeacefully and happily with her children for many years.  She took\nthe two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and\nevery year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red.\n"
