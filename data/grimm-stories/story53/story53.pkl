S"There was once upon a time a princess, who, high under the\nbattlements in her castle, had an apartment with twelve windows,\nwhich looked out in every possible direction, and when she climbed\nup to it and looked around her, she could inspect her whole kingdom.\nWhen she looked out of the first, her sight was more keen than that\nof any other human being, from the second she could see still\nbetter, from the third more distinctly still, and so it went on,\nuntil the twelfth, from which she saw everything above the earth\nand under the earth, and nothing at all could be\nkept secret from her.  Moreover, as she was haughty, and would be\nsubject to no one, but wished to keep the dominion for herself\nalone, she caused it to be proclaimed that no one should ever be\nher husband who could not conceal himself from her so effectively,\nthat it should be quite impossible for her to find him.  He who\ntried this, however, and was discovered by her, was to have his\nhead struck off, and stuck on a post.  Ninety-seven posts with the\nheads of dead men were already standing before the castle, and no\none had come forward for a long time.  The princess was delighted,\nand thought to herself, now I shall be free as long as I live.\nThen three brothers appeared before her, and announced to her\nthat they were desirous of trying their luck.  The eldest believed\nhe would be quite safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw\nhim from the first window, made him come out, and had his head\ncut off.  The second crept into the cellar of the palace, but she\nperceived him also from the first window, and his fate was sealed.\nHis head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post.  Then the\nyoungest came to her and entreated her to give him a day for\nconsideration, and also to be so gracious as to overlook it if she\nshould happen to discover him twice, but if he failed the third\ntime, he would look on his life as over.  As he was so handsome,\nand begged so earnestly, she said, yes, I will grant you that, but\nyou will not succeed.\nNext day he meditated for a long time how he should hide\nhimself, but all in vain.  Then he seized his gun and went out\nhunting.  He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just\ngoing to fire, when the bird cried, don't shoot, I will reward\nyou.  He put his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he\nsurprised a large fish which had come up from the depths below\nto the surface of the water.  When he had aimed at it, the fish\ncried, don't shoot, and I will reward you.  He allowed it to dive\ndown again, went onwards, and met a fox which was lame.  He\nfired and missed it, and the fox cried, you had much better come\nhere and draw the thorn out of my foot for me.  He did this, but\nwhen he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the fox said, stop,\nand I will reward you.  The youth let him go, and then as it\nwas evening, returned home.\nNext day he was to hide himself, but no matter how he puzzled\nhis brains over it, he did not know where.  He went into the\nforest to the raven and said, I let you live on, so now tell me\nwhere I am to hide myself, so that the king's daughter will not\nsee me.  The raven hung his head and thought it over for a long\ntime.  At length he croaked, I have it.  He fetched an egg out of\nhis nest, cut it into two parts, and shut the youth inside it,\nthen made it whole again, and seated himself on it.  When the\nking's daughter went to the first window she could not discover\nhim, nor could she from the others, and she began to be uneasy,\nbut from the eleventh she saw him.  She ordered the raven to be\nshot, and the egg to be brought and broken, and the youth was\nforced to come out.  She said, for once you are excused, but if\nyou do not better than this, you are lost.  Next day he went to\nthe lake, called the fish to him and said, I suffered you to live,\nnow tell me where to hide myself so that the king's daughter\nmay not see me.  The fish thought for a while, and at last\ncried, I have it, I will shut you up in my stomach.  He\nswallowed him, and went down to the bottom of the lake.  The\nking's daughter looked through her windows, and even from the\neleventh did not see him, and was alarmed, but at length from\nthe twelfth she saw him.  She ordered the fish to be caught and\nkilled, and then the youth appeared.  It is easy to imagine the\nstate of mind he was in.  She said, twice you are forgiven, but\nbe sure that your head will be set on the hundredth post.\nOn the last day, he went with a heavy heart into the country, and\nmet the fox.  You know how to find all kinds of hiding-places,\nsaid he, I let you live, now advise me where I shall hide myself\nso that\nthe king's daughter shall not discover me.  That's a hard task,\nanswered the fox, looking very thoughtful.  At length he cried,\nI have it, and went with him to a spring, dipped himself in it,\nand came out as a stall-keeper in the market, and dealer in\nanimals.  The youth had to dip himself in the water also, and\nwas changed into a small sea-hare.  The merchant went into the\ntown, and showed the pretty little animal, and many persons\ngathered together to see it.  At length the king's daughter\ncame likewise, and as she liked it very much, she bought it,\nand gave the merchant a good deal of money for it.  Before he\ngave it over to her, he said to it, when the king's daughter goes\nto the window, creep quickly under the braids of her her hair.\nAnd now the time arrived when she was to search for him.  She\nwent to one window after another in turn, from the first to the\neleventh, and did not see him.  When she did not see him from the\ntwelfth either, she was full of anxiety and anger, and shut it\ndown with such violence that the glass in every window shivered\ninto a thousand pieces, and the whole castle shook.\nShe went back and felt the sea-hare beneath the braids of her\nhair.  Then she seized it, and threw it on the ground exclaiming,\naway with you, get out of my sight.  It ran to the merchant, and\nboth of them hurried to the spring, wherein they plunged, and\nreceived back their true forms.  The youth thanked the fox, and\nsaid, the raven and the fish are idiots compared with you, you\nknow the right tune to play, there is no denying that.\nThe youth went straight to the palace.  The princess was already\nexpecting him, and abandoned herself to her fate.  The wedding\nwas solemnized, and now he was king, and lord of all the kingdom.\nHe never told her where he had concealed himself for the third\ntime, and who had helped him, so she believed that he had done\neverything by his own skill, and she had a great respect for him,\nfor she thought to herself, he is able to do more than I.\n"
