S"There was once upon a time a queen who had a little daughter who\nwas still so young that she had to be carried.  One day the\nchild was naughty, and the mother might say what she liked, but\nthe child would not be quiet.  Then she became impatient, and as\nthe ravens were flying about the palace, she opened the\nwindow and said, I wish you were a raven and would fly away,\nand then I should have some rest.  Scarcely had she spoken the\nwords, before the child was changed into a raven, and flew from\nher arms out of the window.  It flew into a dark forest, and\nstayed in it a long time, and the parents heard nothing of their\nchild.\n\nThen one day a man was on his way through this forest\nand heard the raven crying, and followed the voice, and when\nhe came nearer, the bird said, I am a king's daughter by birth,\nand am bewitched, but you can set me free.  What am I to do, asked\nhe.  She said, go further into the forest, and you will find\na house, wherein sits an aged woman, who will offer you meat\nand drink, but you must accept nothing, for if you eat and\ndrink anything, you will fall into a sleep, and then you will\nnot be able to set me free.  In the garden behind the house\nthere is a great heap of tan, and on this you shall stand\nand wait for me.  For three days I will come every afternoon at\ntwo o'clock in a carriage.  On the first day four white horses\nwill be harnessed to it, then four chestnut horses, and lastly\nfour black ones, but if you are not awake, but sleeping, I shall\nnot be set free.  The man promised to do everything that she\ndesired, but the raven said, alas, I know already that you will\nnot set me free, you will accept something from the woman.  Then\nthe man once more promised that he would certainly not touch\nanything either to eat or to drink.\n\nBut when he entered the house the old woman came\nto him and said, poor man, how faint you are, come and refresh\nyourself, eat and drink.  No, said the man, I will not eat or\ndrink.  She, however, let him have no peace, and said, if\nyou will not eat, take one drink out of the glass, one is\nnothing.  Then he let himself be persuaded, and drank.  Shortly\nbefore two o'clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the\ntan heap to wait for the raven.  As he was standing there, his\nweariness all at once became so great that he could not struggle\nagainst it, and lay down for a short time, but he was determined\nnot to go to sleep.  Hardly, however, had he lain down, than\nhis eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell asleep and\nslept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him.\n\nAt two o'clock the raven came driving up with four white horses,\nbut she was already in deep grief and said, I know he is asleep.\nAnd when she came into the garden, he was indeed lying there\nasleep on the heap of tan.  She alighted from the carriage, went\nto him, shook him, and called him, but he did not awake.  Next\nday about noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and\ndrink, but he would not take any of it.  But she let him have no\nrest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink\nout of the glass.  Towards two o'clock he went into the garden to\nthe tan heap to wait for the raven, but all at once felt such\na great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him.\nHe could not help himself, and was forced to lie down, and fell\ninto a heavy sleep.\n\nWhen the raven drove up with four brown\nhorses, she was already full of grief, and said, I know he is\nasleep.  She went to him, but there he lay sleeping, and there was\nno wakening him.  Next day the old woman asked what was the meaning\nof this.  He was neither eating nor drinking anything, did he want\nto die.  He replied, I am not allowed to eat or drink, and will\nnot do so.  But she set a dish with food, and a glass with wine\nbefore him, and when he smelt it he could not resist, and swallowed\na deep draught.  When the time came, he went out into the garden\nto the heap of tan, and waited for the king's daughter,\nbut he became still more weary than on the day before, and lay down\nand slept as\nsoundly as if he had been a stone.  At two o'clock the raven came\nwith four black horses, and the coachman and everything else was\nblack.  She was already in the deepest grief, and said, I know\nthat he is asleep and cannot set me free.\n\nWhen she came to him,\nthere he was lying fast asleep.  She shook him and called him,\nbut she could not waken him.  Then she laid a loaf beside him,\nand after that a piece of meat, and thirdly a bottle of wine, and\nhe might consume as much of all of them as he liked, but they would\nnever grow less.  After this she took a gold ring from her finger,\nand put it on his, and her name was graven on it.  Lastly, she\nlaid a letter beside him wherein was written what she had given\nhim, and that none of the things would ever grow less, and in it\nwas also written, I see right well that here you will never be able\nto set me free, but if you are still willing to do so, come to\nthe golden castle of Stromberg; it lies in your power, of that I\nam certain.  And when she had given him all these things,\nshe seated herself in her carriage, and drove to the golden castle\nof Stromberg.\n\nWhen the man awoke and saw that he had slept, he was sad at heart,\nand said, she has certainly driven by, and I have not set her free.\nThen he perceived the things which were lying beside him,\nand read the letter wherein was written how everything had\nhappened.  So he arose and went away, intending to go to the golden\ncastle of Stromberg, but he did not know where it was.  After he\nhad walked about the world for a long time, he entered into a dark\nforest, and walked for fourteen days, and still could not find his\nway out.  Then it was once more evening, and he was so tired that\nhe lay down in a thicket and fell asleep.  Next day he went\nonwards, and in the evening, as he was again about to lie down\nbeneath some bushes, he heard such a howling and crying that he\ncould not go to sleep.  And at the time when people light the\ncandles, he saw one glimmering, and arose and went towards it.\n\nThen he came to a house which seemed very small, for in front\nof it a great giant was standing.  He thought to himself, if I go\nin, and the giant sees me, it will very likely cost me my life.\nAt length he ventured it and went in.  When the giant saw him,\nhe said, it is well that you come, for it is long since I have\neaten, I will at once devour you for my supper.  I'd rather\nyou did not, said the man, I do not like to be eaten, but if\nyou have any desire to eat, I have quite enough here to satisfy\nyou.  If that be true, said the giant, you may be easy, I was only\ngoing to devour you because I had nothing else.\n\nThen they went,\nand sat down to the table, and the man took out the bread, wine,\nand meat which would never come to an end.  This pleases me\nwell, said the giant, and ate to his heart's content.  Then\nthe man said to him, can you tell me where the golden castle\nof Stromberg is.  The giant said, I will look at my map,\nall the towns, and villages, and houses are to be found on it.\n\nHe brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the\ncastle, but it was not to be found on it.  It's no matter, said\nhe, I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs,\nand we will look at them.  But there, too, it was in vain.  The\nman now wanted to set out again, but the giant begged him to\nwait a few days longer until his brother, who had gone out to\nbring some provisions, came home.  When the brother came home\nthey inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg.  He replied,\nwhen I have eaten and have had enough, I will look at the map.\n\nThen he went with them up to his chamber, and they searched\non his map, but could not find it.  Then he brought out still\nolder maps, and they never rested until they found the golden\ncastle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away.  How\nam I to get there, asked the man.  The giant said, I have two\nhours, time, during which I will carry you into the neighborhood,\nbut after that I must be at home to suckle the child that we have.\n\nSo the giant carried the man to about a hundred leagues from\nthe castle, and said, you can very well walk the rest of the way\nalone.  And he turned back, but the man went onwards day and\nnight, until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg.\n\nIt stood on a glass-mountain, and the bewitched maiden was\ndriving in her carriage round the castle, and then went inside\nit.  He rejoiced when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her,\nbut when he began to do so he always slipped down the glass again.\nAnd when he saw that he could not reach her, he was very worried,\nand said to himself, I will stay down here below, and wait for\nher.  So he built himself a hut and stayed in it for a whole year,\nand every day saw the king's daughter driving about above, but\nnever could reach her.\n\nThen one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating\neach other, and cried to them, God be with you.  They stopped\nwhen they heard the cry, but as they saw no one, they once more\nbegan to beat each other, and that too most dangerously.  So he\nagain cried, God be with you.  Again they stopped, looked\nround about, but as they saw no one they went on beating each\nother.  Then he cried for the third time, God be with you, and\nthought, I must see what these three are about, and went thither\nand asked why they were beating each other so furiously.  One of\nthem said that he found a stick, and that when he struck a door\nwith it, that door would spring open.  The next said that he had\nfound a mantle, and that whenever he put it on, he was invisible,\nbut the third said he had found a horse on which a man could\nride everywhere even up the glass-mountain.  And now they did not know\nwhether they ought to have these things in common, or whether\nthey ought to divide them.\n\nThen the man said, I will give you\nsomething in exchange for these three things.  Money indeed\nhave I not, but I have other things of more value, but first I\nmust make an experiment to see if you have told the truth.  Then\nthey put him on the horse, threw the mantle round him, and gave\nhim the stick in his hand, and when he had all these things\nthey were no longer able to see him.  So he gave them some\nvigorous blows and cried, now, vagabonds, you have got what you\ndeserve, are you satisfied.  And he rode up the glass-mountain,\nbut when he came in front of the castle at the top, it was shut.\n\nThen he struck the door with his stick, and it sprang open\nimmediately.  He went in and ascended the stairs until he\ncame to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden\ngloblet of wine before her.  She, however, could not see him\nbecause he had the mantle on.  And when he came up to her,\nhe drew from his finger the ring which she had given him, and\nthrew it into the goblet so that it rang.  Then she cried, that\nis my ring, so the man who is to set me free must be here.\n\nThey searched the whole castle and did not find him, but he had gone\nout, and had seated himself on the horse and thrown off the\nmantle.  When they came to the door, they saw him and cried\naloud in their delight.  Then he alighted and took the king's\ndaughter in his arms, but she kissed him and said, now have you\nset me free, and to-morrow we will celebrate our wedding.\n"
