St. Peter and the Lord stay one evening at a blacksmith's house. A poor old man comes by seeking money. They have pity on the man and make him young so he can earn his own way. They borrow the smith's forge, heat the man up, and then cool him in a tub of water. The old man comes out as young as a teenager. The smith decides to try this on his aged mother-in-law. During the process she screams and cries so that she wakes her pregnant daughter and daughter-in-law. The sight of the burnt woman scares them so much that both women go into labor and give birth. Instead of being human babies though, the women give birth to apes.
