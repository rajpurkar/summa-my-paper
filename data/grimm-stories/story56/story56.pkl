The woman warns them they shouldn't stay, but hides them behind the stove and promises them any scraps. The soldier goes out from behind the stove, sits with the robbers, and eats. He puts a charm on them so they are immobile as he and the huntsman eat their fill. The old lady then shows them the way to the closest town. The soldier alerts his comrades that he has found a group of robbers. They bind the men and drive them back into town. As they come closer to the town, the soldier begins to hear sounds of a celebration. He learns the king has been away and is arriving back in town..."

S"A soldier who is afraid of nothing, troubles himself about\nnothing.  One of this kind had received his discharge, and\nas he had learnt no trade and could earn nothing, he traveled\nabout and begged alms of kind people.  He had an old rain-coat\non his back, and a pair of riding-boots of buffalo-leather which\nwere still left to him.  One day he was walking he knew not where,\nstraight out into the open country, and at length came to a forest.\nHe did not know where he was, but saw sitting on the trunk of a\ntree, which had been cut down, a man who was well dressed and\nwore a green shooting-coat.  The soldier shook hands with him, sat\ndown on the grass by his side, and stretched out his legs.  I see\nyou have good boots on, which are well blacked, said he to the\nhuntsman, but if you had to travel about as I have, they would\nnot last long.  Look at mine, they are of buffalo-leather, and\nhave been worn for a long time, but in them I can go through thick\nand thin.  After a while the soldier got up and said, I can stay\nno longer, hunger drives me onwards, but, brother brightboots,\nwhere does this road lead to.  I don't know that myself, answered\nthe huntsman, I have lost my way in the forest.  Then you are in the\nsame plight as I, said the soldier.  Birds of a feather flock\ntogether, let us remain together, and seek our way.  The huntsman\nsmiled a little, and they walked on further and further, until\nnight fell.  We do not get out of the forest, said the soldier,\nbut there in the distance I see a light shining.  There we might\nfind something to eat.  They found a stone house, knocked at the\ndoor, and an old woman opened it.  We are looking for quarters for\nthe night, said the soldier, and some lining for our stomachs, for\nmine is as empty as\nan old knapsack.  You cannot stay here, answered the old woman.\nThis is a robbers, house, and you would do wisely to get away\nbefore they come home, or you will be lost.  It won't be so bad\nas that, answered the soldier, I have not had a mouthful for two\ndays, and whether I am murdered here or die of hunger in the\nforest is all the same to me.  I shall come in.  The huntsman\nwould not follow, but the soldier drew him in with him by the\nsleeve.  Come, my dear brother, we shall not come to an end so\nquickly as that.  The old woman had pity on them and said, creep\nin here behind the stove, and if they leave anything, I will give\nit to you on the sly when they are asleep.  Scarcely were they in\nthe corner before twelve robbers came bursting in, seated themselves\nat the table which was already laid, and vehemently demanded some\nfood.  The old woman brought in some great dishes of roast meat,\nand the robbers enjoyed that thoroughly.  When the soldier smelled\nthe food, he said to the huntsman, I cannot hold out any\nlonger, I shall seat myself at the table, and eat with them.  You\nwill bring us to destruction, said the huntsman, and held him back\nby the arm.  But the soldier began to cough loudly.  When the\nrobbers heard that, they threw away their knives and forks, leapt\nup, and discovered the two who were behind the stove.  Aha,\ngentlemen, are you in the corner, cried they.  What are you doing\nhere.  Have you been sent as spies.  Wait a while, and you shall\nlearn how to\nfly on a dry bough.  But do be civil, said the soldier, I am\nhungry, give me something to eat, and then you can do what you\nlike with me.  The robbers were astonished, and the captain said,\nI see that you have no fear.  Well, you shall have some food,\nbut after that you must die.  We shall see, said the soldier, and\nseated himself at the table, and began to cut away valiantly at the\nroast meat.  Brother brightboots, come and eat, cried he to the\nhuntsman.  You must be as hungry as I am, and cannot have better\nroast meat at home, but the huntsman would not eat.  The robbers\nlooked at the soldier in astonishment, and said, the rascal uses\nno ceremony.  After a while he said, I have had enough food, now\nget me something good to drink.  The chief of the robbers was\nin the mood to humor him in this also, and called to the old\nwoman, bring a bottle out of the cellar, and mind it be of the\nbest.  The soldier drew the cork out with a loud noise, and then\nwent with the bottle to the huntsman and said, watch this, brother,\nand you shall see something that will surprise you.  I am now going\nto drink the health of the whole clan.  Then he brandished the\nbottle over the heads of the robbers, and cried, long life to\nyou all, but with your mouths open and your right hands lifted\nup, and then he drank a hearty draught.  Scarcely were the\nwords said than they all sat motionless as if made of stone,\nand their mouths were open and their right hands stretched up in\nthe air.  The huntsman said to the soldier, I see that you are\nacquainted with tricks of another kind, but now come and let us\ngo home.  Oho, my dear brother, but that would be marching\naway far too soon.  We have conquered the enemy, and must first\ntake the booty.  Those men there are sitting fast, and are opening\ntheir mouths with astonishment, but they will not be allowed to\nmove until I permit them.  Come, eat and drink.  The old woman\nhad to bring another bottle of the best wine, and the soldier would\nnot stir until he had eaten enough to last for three days.  At\nlast when day came, he said, now it is time to strike our tents,\nand in order that our march may be a short one, the old woman\nshall show us the nearest way to the town.\n\nWhen they had arrived there, he went to his old comrades, and\nsaid, out in the forest I have found a nest full of gallows,\nbirds, come with me and we will take it.  The soldier led them,\nand said to the huntsman, you must go back again with me to see\nhow they flutter when we seize them by the feet.  He placed\nthe men round about the robbers, and then he took the bottle,\ndrank a mouthful, brandished it above them, and cried, long life\nto you all.  Instantly they all regained the power of movement,\nbut were thrown down and bound hand and foot with cords.\nThen the soldier ordered them to be thrown into a cart as if\nthey had been so many sacks, and said, now drive them straight\nto prison.  The huntsman, however, took one of the men aside\nand gave him another commission as well.\n\nBrother brightboots, said the soldier, we have safely routed\nthe enemy and been well fed, now we will quietly walk behind\nthem as if we were stragglers.  When they approached the town,\nthe soldier saw a crowd of people pouring through the gate of\nthe town who were raising loud cries of joy, and waving green\nboughs in the air.  Then he saw that the entire body-guard was\ncoming up.  What can this mean, said he to the huntsman.\n\nDon't you know, he replied, that the king has for a long time\nbeen absent from his kingdom, and that today he is returning,\nand every one is going to meet him.  But where is the king,\nsaid the soldier.  I do not see him.  Here he is, answered\nthe huntsman, I am the king, and have announced my arrival.\n\nThen he opened his hunting-coat, and his royal garments were\nvisible.  The soldier was alarmed, and fell on his knees and\nbegged him to forgive him for having in his ignorance treated\nhim as an equal, and spoken to him by such a name.  But the\nking shook hands with him, and said, you are a brave soldier,\nand have saved my life.  You shall never again be in want,\nI will take care of you.  And if ever you would like to eat\na piece of roast meat, as good as that in the robber's house,\ncome to the royal kitchen.  But if you would drink a health,\nyou must first ask my permission.\n\n"
