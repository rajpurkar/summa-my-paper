S'There was once upon a time a king who had twelve daughters, each one\nmore beautiful than the other.  They all slept together in one\nchamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when\nthey were in them the king locked the door, and bolted it.  But in\nthe morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were\nworn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to\npass.  Then the king caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could\ndiscover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for\nhis wife and be king after his death, but that whosoever came forward\nand had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have\nforfeited his life.\n\nIt was not long before a king\'s son presented himself, and offered to\nundertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening\nwas led into a room adjoining the princesses, sleeping-chamber.  His\nbed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and\ndanced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away\nto some other place, the door of their room was left open. But the\neyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and\nwhen he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for\ntheir shoes were standing there with holes in the soles.  On the\nsecond and third nights there was no difference, and then his head\nwas struck off without mercy.\n\nMany others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all\nforfeited their lives.  Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who\nhad a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to\nthe town where the king lived.  There he met an old woman, who asked\nhim where he was going.  "I hardly know myself," answered he, and\nadded in jest, "I had half a mind to discover where the princesses\ndanced their shoes into holes, and thus become king." "That is not so\ndifficult," said the old woman, "you must not drink the wine which\nwill be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound\nasleep." With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, "If you\nwear this, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the\ntwelve." When the soldier had received this good advice, he fell to\nin earnest, took heart, went to the king, and announced himself as a\nsuitor.  He was as well received as the others, and royal garments\nwere put upon him.  He was conducted that evening at bed-time into\nthe antechamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came\nand brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his\nchin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop.\n\nThen he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as\nif in the deepest sleep.  The twelve princesses heard that, and\nlaughed, and the eldest said, "He, too, might as well have saved his\nlife." With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards,\nand brought out pretty dresses, dressed themselves before the\nmirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance.\nOnly the youngest said, "I know not how it is, you are very happy,\nbut I feel very strange, some misfortune is certainly about to befall\nus." "You are a goose, who are always frightened," said the eldest.\n"Have you forgotten how many kings\' sons have already come here in\nvain.  I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught,\nthe booby would not have awakened anyway."\n\nWhen they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he\nhad closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves\nsafe enough.  The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it,\nwhereupon it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other\nthey descended through the opening, the eldest going first.  The\nsoldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his\nlittle cloak, and went down last with the youngest.  Half-way down\nthe steps, he just trod a little on her dress, she was terrified at\nthat, and cried out, "What is that?  Who is pulling my dress?" "Don\'t\nbe so silly," said the eldest, "you have caught it on a nail."\n\nThen they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom,\nthey were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the\nleaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier\nthought, "I must carry a token away with me," and broke off a twig\nfrom one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report.  The\nyoungest cried out again.  "Something is wrong, did you hear the\ncrack?" But the eldest said, "It is a gun fired for joy, because we\nhave got rid of our prince so quickly." After that they came into an\navenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third\nwhere they were of bright diamonds, he broke off a twig from each,\nwhich made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in\nterror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes.\n\nThey went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little\nboats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were\nwaiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the\nsoldier seated himself by the youngest.  Then her prince said, "I\nwonder why the boat is so much heavier to-day. I shall have to row\nwith all my strength, if I am to get it across." "What should cause\nthat," said the youngest, "but the warm weather?" "I feel very warm\ntoo." On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit\ncastle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and\nkettle-drums.  They rowed there, entered, and each prince danced with\nthe girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when\none of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the\ncup was empty when she carried it to her mouth, the youngest was\nalarmed at this, but the eldest always silenced her.  They danced\nthere till three o\'clock in the morning when all the shoes were\ndanced into holes, and they were forced to leave off, the princes\nrowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated\nhimself by the eldest.\n\nOn the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return\nthe following night.  When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on\nin front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up\nslowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could\nall hear him, and they said, "So far as he is concerned, we are\nsafe." They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the\nworn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down.  Next morning the soldier\nwas resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings-on, and\nagain went with them a second and a third night.\n\nThen everything was just as it had been the first time, and each time\nthey danced until their shoes were worn to pieces.  But the third\ntime he took a cup away with him as a token.  When the hour had\narrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the\ncup, and went to the king, but the twelve stood behind the door, and\nlistened for what he was going to say.  When the king put the\nquestion, "Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to\npieces in the night?" He answered, "In an underground castle with\ntwelve princes," and related how it had come to pass, and brought out\nthe tokens.  The king then summoned his daughters, and asked them if\nthe soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were\nbetrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged\nto confess all.  Thereupon the king asked which of them he would have\nto wife.  He answered, "I am no longer young, so give me the eldest."\nThen the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom\nwas promised him after the king\'s death.  But the princes were\nbewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve.\n'
