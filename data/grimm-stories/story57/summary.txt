Each night twelve princesses wear their shoes out with dancing, even though they are locked in their room. The king seeks someone to find what his daughters are doing each night. A wounded soldier accepts the challenge. He discovers the secret passageway the girls follow to meet their suitors to dance the night away. As a reward for his work, the soldier is given the oldest princess as his wife and is promised he will be king after the current king passes away.
