S"There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little\npeasant.  He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money\nto buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one.  One\nday he said to her, listen, I have a good idea, there is our\ngossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it\nbrown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will\ncertainly get big and be a cow.  The woman also liked the idea, and\ntheir gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted\nit as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as\nif it were eating.\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little\npeasant called the cow-herd and said, look, I have a little calf\nthere, but it is still small and has to be carried.  The cow-herd\nsaid, all right, and took it in his arms and carried it to the\npasture, and set it among the grass.  The little calf always\nremained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said,\nit will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already.  At\nnight when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to\nthe calf, if you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also\ngo on your four legs.  I don't care to drag you home again in\nmy arms.  But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for\nhis little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\nthe village, and the calf was\nmissing, he inquired where it was.  The cow-herd answered, it is\nstill standing out there eating.  It would not stop and come\nwith us.  But the little peasant said, oh, but I must have my\nbeast back again.  Then they went back to the meadow together,\nbut someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone.  The cow-herd\nsaid, it must have run away.  The peasant, however, said, don't\ntell me that, and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his\ncarelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the\ncalf which had run away.\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which\nthey had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they\nhad no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it\nsoon had to be killed.  They salted the flesh, and the peasant went\ninto the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might\nbuy a new calf with the proceeds.  On the way he passed by a mill,\nand there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took\nhim and wrapped him in the skin.  But as the weather grew so\nbad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther,\nand turned back to the mill and begged for shelter.  The miller's\nwife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant, lay yourself\non the straw there, and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.  The\npeasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the\nwoman thought, he is tired and has gone to sleep.  In the\nmeantime came the parson.  The miller's wife received him well,\nand said, my husband is out, so we will have a feast.  The\npeasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting\nhe was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice\nof bread and cheese.  Then the woman served up four different\nthings, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\noutside.  The woman said, oh, heavens.  It is my husband.  She\nquickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine\nunder the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and\nthe parson in the closet on the porch.  Then she opened the\ndoor for her husband, and said, thank heaven, you are back\nagain.  There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were\ncoming to an end.  The miller\nsaw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, what is that\nfellow doing there.  Ah, said the wife, the poor knave came in\nthe storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit\nof bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.  The man\nsaid, I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to\neat.  The woman said, but I have nothing but bread and cheese.  I\nam contented with anything, replied the husband, so far as I am\nconcerned, bread and cheese will do, and looked at the peasant\nand said, come and eat some more with me.  The peasant did not\nrequire to be invited twice, but got up and ate.  After this the\nmiller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground,\nand asked, what have you there.  The peasant answered, I have a\nsoothsayer inside it.  Can he foretell anything to me, said the\nmiller.  Why not, answered the peasant, but he only says four\nthings, and the fifth he keeps to himself.  The miller was curious,\nand said, let him foretell something for once.  Then the peasant\npinched the raven's head, so that he croaked and made a noise\nlike krr, krr.  The miller said, what did he say.  The peasant\nanswered, in the first place, he says that there is some wine\nhidden under the pillow.  Bless me, cried the miller, and went\nthere and found the wine.  Now go on, said he.  The peasant\nmade the raven croak again, and said, in the second place, he\nsays that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.  Upon my\nword, cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast\nmeat.  The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said,\nthirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed.  That\nwould be a fine thing, cried the miller, and went there and found\nthe salad.  At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till\nhe croaked, and said, fourthly, he says that there are some\ncakes under the bed.  That would be a fine thing, cried the\nmiller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller's\nwife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the\nkeys with her.  The miller would have liked much to know the\nfifth, but the little peasant said, first, we will quickly\neat the four things, for the fifth is something bad.  So they\nate, and after that they\nbargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophesy,\nuntil they agreed on three hundred talers.  Then the peasant\nonce more pinched the raven's head till he croaked loudly.  The\nmiller asked, what did he say.  The peasant replied, he says that\nthe devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch.\nThe miller said, the devil must go out, and opened the house-door.\nThen the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant\nunlocked the closet.  The parson ran out as fast as he could, and\nthe miller said, it was true.  I saw the black rascal with my own\neyes.  The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak\nwith the three hundred talers.\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out.  He built a\nbeautiful house, and the peasants said, the small peasant has\ncertainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people\ncarry the gold home in shovels.  Then the small peasant was\nbrought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence his\nwealth came.  He answered, I sold my cow's skin in the town, for\nthree hundred talers.  When the peasants heard that, they too\nwished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their\ncows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the\ntown to the greatest advantage.  The mayor, however, said, but\nmy servant must go first.  When she came to the merchant in the\ntown, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and\nwhen the others came, he did not give them so much, and said,\nwhat can I do with all these skins.\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have\nthus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused\nhim of this treachery before the mayor.  The innocent little\npeasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled\ninto the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes.  He was led\nforth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his\nsoul.  The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and\nwhen the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who\nhad been with the miller's wife.  He said to him, I set you free\nfrom the closet, set me free from the barrel.  At this same\nmoment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom\nthe peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried\nwith all his might, no, I will not do it.  If the whole world\ninsists on it, I will not do it.  The shepherd hearing that,\ncame up to him, and asked, what are you about.  What is it that\nyou will not do.  The peasant said, they want to make me mayor,\nif I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\nThe shepherd said, if nothing more than that is needful in order\nto be mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.  The peasant\nsaid, if you will get in, you will be mayor.  The shepherd was\nwilling, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him.\nThen he took the shepherd's flock for himself, and drove it away.\nThe parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had\nbeen said.  Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the\nwater.  When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried, I am\nquite willing to be mayor.  They believed no otherwise than that\nit was the peasant who was saying this, and answered, that is\nwhat we intend, but first you shall look about you a little\ndown below there, and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering\nthe village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a\nflock of sheep and looking quite contented.  Then the peasants\nwere astonished, and said, peasant, from whence do you come.\nHave you come out of the water.  Yes, truly, replied the\npeasant, I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom.\nI pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there\nwere pretty meadows\non which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I\nbrought this flock away with me.  Said the peasants, are there\nany more.  Oh, yes, said he, more than I could want.  Then\nthe peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some\nsheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said, I\ncome first.  So they went to the water together, and just then\nthere were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water,\nwhereupon the peasants cried, we already see the sheep down\nbelow.  The mayor pressed forward and said, I will go down first,\nand look about me, and if things promise well I'll call you.\nSo he jumped in.  Splash, went the water.  It sounded as if\nhe were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after\nhim as one man.  Then the entire village was dead, and the\nsmall peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\n"
