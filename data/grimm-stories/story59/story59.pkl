S'There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son,\nand as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted\nthat in his fourteenth year he would have the king\'s daughter\nfor his wife.  It happened that soon afterwards the king\ncame into the village, and no one knew that he was the king,\nand when he asked the people what news there was, they answered,\na child has just been born with a caul on, whatever anyone so\nborn undertakes turns out well.  It is prophesied, too, that\nin his fourteenth year he will have the king\'s daughter for his\nwife.\n\nThe king, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy,\nwent to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, you poor\npeople, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.  At\nfirst they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large\namount of gold for it, and they thought, it is a child of good\nfortune, and everything must turn out well for it, they at last\nconsented, and gave him the child.\n\nThe king put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to\na deep piece of water, then he threw the box into it and thought,\nI have freed my daughter from her undesired suitor.\n\nThe box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not\na drop of water made its way into it.  And it floated to within\ntwo miles of the king\'s chief city, where there was a mill, and\nit came to a halt at the mill-dam.  A miller\'s boy, who by good\nluck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook,\nthinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened\nit there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively.  He\ntook him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children\nthey were glad, and said, "God has given him to us."  They took\ngreat care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness.\n\nIt happened that once in a storm, the king went into the mill, and\nasked the mill-folk if the tall youth were their son.  No,\nanswered they, he\'s a foundling.  Fourteen years ago he floated\ndown to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out\nof the water.\n\nThen the king knew that it was none other than the child of\ngood fortune which he had thrown into the water, and he said,\nmy good people, could not the youth take a letter to the queen.\nI will give him two gold pieces as a reward.  Just as the king\ncommands, answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself\nin readiness.  Then the king wrote a letter to the queen, wherein\nhe said, as soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be\nkilled and buried, and all must be done before I come home.\nThe boy set out with this letter, but he lost his way, and in the\nevening came to a large forest.  In the darkness he saw a small\nlight, he went towards it and reached a cottage.  When he went in,\nan old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone.  She started\nwhen she saw the boy, and said, whence do you come, and whither\nare you going.  I come from the mill, he answered, and wish\nto go to the queen, to whom I am taking a letter, but as I have\nlost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.\nYou poor boy, said the woman, you have come into a den of thieves,\nand when they come home they will kill you.  Let them come,\nsaid the boy, I am not afraid, but I am so tired that I cannot go\nany farther.  And he stretched himself upon a bench and fell\nasleep.\n\nSoon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange\nboy was lying there.  Ah, said the old woman, it is an innocent\nchild who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have\nlet him come in, he has to take a letter to the queen.  The robbers\nopened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the\nboy as soon as he arrived should be put to death.  Then the\nhardhearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter\nand wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should\nbe married at once to the king\'s daughter.  Then they let him lie\nquietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke\nthey gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.\n\nAnd the queen, when she had received the letter and read it,\ndid as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast\nprepared, and the king\'s daughter was married to the child of\ngood fortune, and as the youth was handsome and friendly she lived\nwith him in joy and contentment.\n\nAfter some time the king returned to his palace and saw that\nthe prophecy was fulfilled, and the child married to his daughter.\nHow has that come to pass, said he, I gave quite another order\nin my letter.\n\nSo the queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for\nhimself what was written in it.  The king read the letter and\nsaw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.  He\nasked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him,\nand why he had brought another instead of it.  I know nothing\nabout it, answered he, it must have been changed in the night,\nwhen I slept in the forest.  The king said in a passion, you shall\nnot have everything quite so much your own way, whosoever marries\nmy daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from\nthe head of the devil, bring me what I want, and you shall keep\nmy daughter.  In this way the king hoped to be rid of him for ever.\nBut the child of good fortune answered, I will fetch the golden\nhairs, I am not afraid of the devil.  Whereupon he took leave of\nthem and began his journey.\n\nThe road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates\nasked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  I know\neverything, answered the child of good fortune.  Then you can do us\na favor, said the watchman, if you will tell us why our market\nfountain, which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no\nlonger gives even water.  That you shall know, answered he, only\nwait until I come back.\n\nThen he went farther and came to another town, and there also the\ngatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew.\nI know everything, answered he.  Then you can do us a favor and\ntell us why a tree in our town which once bore golden apples now\ndoes not even put forth leaves.  You shall know that, answered he,\nonly wait until I come back.\n\nThen he went on and came to a wide river over which he must cross.\nThe ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  I\nknow everything, answered he.  Then you can do me a favor, said\nthe ferryman, and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards\nand forwards, and am never set free.  You shall know that,\nanswered he, only wait until I come back.\n\nWhen he had crossed the water he found the entrance to hell.  It\nwas black and sooty within, and the devil was not at home, but\nhis grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.  What do you\nwant, said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked.  I\nshould like to have three golden hairs from the devil\'s head,\nanswered he, else I cannot keep my wife.  That is a good deal\nto ask for, said she, if the devil comes home and finds you, it\nwill cost you your life, but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot\nhelp you.\n\nShe changed him into an ant and said, creep into the folds of my\ndress, you will be safe there.  Yes, answered he, so far, so good,\nbut there are three things besides that I want to know - why a\nfountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no\nlonger gives even water, why a tree which once bore golden apples\ndoes not even put forth leaves, and why a ferryman must always be\ngoing backwards and forwards, and is never set free.\nThose are difficult questions, answered she, but just be silent\nand quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out\nthe three golden hairs.\n\nAs the evening came on, the devil returned home.  No sooner had he\nentered than he noticed that the air was not pure.  I smell man\'s\nflesh, said he, all is not right here.  Then he pried into\nevery corner, and searched, but could not find anything.  His\ngrandmother scolded him.  It has just been swept, said she, and\neverything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again, you\nhave always got man\'s flesh in your nose.  Sit down and eat your\nsupper.\n\nWhen he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in\nhis grandmother\'s lap, and told her she should louse him a little.\nIt was not long before he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing\nheavily.  Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled\nit out, and laid it down beside her.  Oh, cried the devil,\nwhat are you doing.  I have had a bad dream, answered the\ngrandmother, so I seized hold of your hair.  What did you dream\nthen, said the devil.  I dreamt that a fountain in a market-place\nfrom which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water\nwould flow out of it - what is the cause of it.  Oh, ho, if they\ndid but know it, answered the devil, there is a toad sitting\nunder a stone in the well - if they killed it, the wine would flow\nagain.\n\nThe grandmother loused him again until he went to sleep and\nsnored so that the windows shook.  Then she pulled the second hair\nout.  Ha, what are you doing, cried the devil angrily.  Do not\ntake it ill, said she, I did it in a dream.  What have you dreamt\nthis time, asked he.  I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there\nstood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples, but now\nwould not even bear leaves.  What, think you, was the reason.\nOh, if they did but know, answered the devil.  A mouse is\ngnawing at the root - if they killed it they would have golden\napples again, but if it gnaws much longer the tree will wither\naltogether.  But I have had enough of your dreams, if you disturb\nme in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear.\n\nThe grandmother spoke gently to him and picked his lice once\nmore until he fell asleep and snored.  Then she took hold of the\nthird golden hair and pulled it out.  The devil jumped up,\nroared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not\nquieted him again and said, who can help bad dreams.  What\nwas the dream, then, asked he, and was quite curious.  I dreamt\nof a ferryman who complained that he must always ferry from\none side to the other, and was never released.  What is the\ncause of it.  Ah, the fool, answered the devil, when anyone\ncomes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand,\nand the other man will have\nto ferry and he will be free.  As the grandmother had plucked\nout the three golden hairs, and the three questions were\nanswered, she let the old devil alone, and he slept until\ndaybreak.\n\nWhen the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant\nout of the folds of her dress, and gave the child of good\nfortune his human shape again.  There are the three golden\nhairs for you, said she.  What the devil said to your three\nquestions, I suppose you heard.  Yes, answered he, I heard, and\nwill take care to remember.  You have what you want, said she,\nand now you can go your way.  He thanked the old woman for\nhelping him in his need, and left hell well content that\neverything had turned out so fortunately.\n\nWhen he came to the ferryman he was expected to give the\npromised answer.  Ferry me across first, said the child of good\nfortune, and then I will tell you how you can be set free, and\nwhen he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil\'s advice.\nNext time anyone comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the\noar in his hand.\n\nHe went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful\ntree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer.  So he\ntold him what he had heard from the devil.  Kill the mouse\nwhich is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden\napples.  Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward\ntwo asses laden with gold, which followed him.\n\nFinally, he came to the town whose well was dry.  He told the\nwatchman what the devil had said, a toad is in the well beneath\na stone, you must find it and kill it, and the well will again\ngive wine in plenty.  The watchman thanked him, and also\ngave him two asses laden with gold.\n\nAt last the child of good fortune got home to his wife, who\nwas heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had\nprospered in everything.  To the king he took what he had asked\nfor, the devil\'s three golden hairs, and when the king saw the\nfour asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said, now\nall the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter.\n\nBut tell\nme, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from - this\nis tremendous wealth.  I was rowed across a river, answered he,\nand got it there, it lies on the shore instead of sand.  Can I\ntoo fetch some of it, said the king, and he was quite eager\nabout it.  As much as you like, answered he.  There is a\nferryman on the river, let him ferry you over, and you can fill\nyour sacks on the other side.  The greedy king set out in all\nhaste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferryman\nto put him across.  The ferryman came and bade him get in,\nand when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his\nhand and sprang over.  But from this time forth the king had to\nferry, as a punishment for his sins.  Perhaps he is ferrying\nstill.  If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from\nhim.\n'
