S"A lazy man tries to find some way to keep from having to keep watch over his goat all day long. He finally decides to marry his neighbor's daughter who also watches a goat. His thinking is that she can watch both the goats and he can rest. Trina soon becomes tired of herding both goats and asks her husband if they can trade the goats for a beehive. Her reasoning is they wouldn't have to watch the beehive or care for the bees. The husband consents and the trade is made. The couple keeps the honey pot in their bedroom so they don't have to worry about it being stolen. One day as they are talking in bed, the wife makes a gesture with a stick and the pot falls and breaks. The two decide to enjoy the honey off the broken bits of..."

S"Harry was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but\ndrive his goat daily to pasture, he nevertheless groaned\nwhen he went home after his day's work was done.  It is indeed\na heavy burden, said he, and a wearisome employment to drive\na goat into the field this way year after year, till late into\nthe autumn.  If one could but lie down and sleep, but no, one\nmust have\none's eyes open lest the goat hurts the young trees, or squeezes\nitself through the hedge into a garden, or runs away altogether.\nHow can one have any rest, or enjoy one's life.  He seated\nhimself, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could\nset his shoulders free from this burden.  For a long time all\nthinking was to no purpose, but suddenly it was as if scales\nfell from his eyes.  I know what I will do, he cried, I will\nmarry fat trina who has also a goat, and can take mine out with\nhers, and then I shall have no more need to trouble myself.\nSo harry got up, set his weary legs in motion, and went right\nacross the street, for it was no farther, to where the parents of\nfat trina lived, and asked for their industrious and virtuous\ndaughter in marriage.  The parents did not reflect long.  Birds\nof a feather, flock together, they thought, and consented.\nSo fat trina became harry's wife, and led out both the goats.\nHarry had a good time of it, and had no work that he required to\nrest from but his own idleness.  He went out with her only now\nand then, and said, I merely do it that I may afterwards enjoy\nrest more, otherwise one loses all feeling for it.\nBut fat trina was no less idle.  Dear harry, said she one day,\nwhy should we make our lives so toilsome when there is no need\nfor it, and thus ruin the best days of our youth.  Would it not\nbe better for us to give the two goats which disturb us every\nmorning in our sweetest sleep with their bleating, to our\nneighbor, and he will give us a beehive for them.  We will put\nthe beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and trouble\nourselves no more about it.  Bees do not require to be taken\ncare of, or driven into the field.  They fly out and find the way\nhome again for themselves, and collect honey without giving the\nvery least trouble.  You have spoken like a sensible woman,\nreplied harry.  We will carry out your proposal without delay,\nand besides all that, honey tastes better and nourishes one\nbetter than goat's milk, and it can be kept longer too.\nThe neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats.  The\nbees flew in and out from early morning till late evening\nwithout ever tiring, and filled the hive with the most beautiful\nhoney, so\nthat in autumn harry was able to take a whole pitcherful out of\nit.\nThey placed the jug on a board which was fixed to the wall of\ntheir bed-room, and as they were afraid that it might be stolen,\nor that the mice might find it, trina brought in a stout\nhazel-stick and put it beside her bed, so that without\nunnecessary motion she might reach it with her hand, and drive\naway the uninvited guests.\nLazy harry did not like to leave his bed before noon.  He who\nrises early, said he, wastes his substance.  One morning when\nhe was still lying amongst the feathers in broad daylight,\nresting after his long sleep, he said to his wife, women are\nfond of sweet things, and you are always tasting the honey in\nprivate.  It will be better for us to exchange it for a goose\nwith a young gosling, before you eat up the whole of it.  But,\nanswered trina, not before we have a child to take care of them.\nAm I to worry myself with the little geese, and spend all my\nstrength on them to no purpose.  Do you think, said harry, that\nthe youngster will look after geese.  Now-a-days children no\nlonger obey, they do according to their own fancy, because they\nconsider themselves cleverer than their parents, just like\nthat lad who was sent to seek the cow and chased three blackbirds.\nOh, replied trina, this one shall fare badly if he does not do\nwhat I say.  I will take a stick and belabor his skin with more\nblows than I can count.  Look, harry, cried she in her zeal, and\nseized the stick with which she used to drive the mice away, look,\nthis is the way I will fall on him.  She reached her arm out\nto strike, but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed.\nThe pitcher struck against the wall and fell down in shards,\nand the fine honey streamed out on the ground.  There lie the\ngoose and the young gosling, said\nharry, and want no looking after.  But it is lucky that the\npitcher did not fall on my head.  We have all reason to be\nsatisfied with our lot.  And then as he saw that there was still\nsome honey in one of the shards he stretched out his hand for\nit, and said quite gaily, the remains, my wife, we will still\neat with relish, and we will rest a little after the fright we\nhave had.  What does it matter if we do get up a little later.\nThe day is always long enough.  Yes, answered trina, we shall\nalways get to the end of it at the proper time.  You know, the\nsnail was once asked to a wedding and set out to go, but arrived\nat the christening.  In front of the house it fell over the\nfence, and said, speed does no good.\n"
