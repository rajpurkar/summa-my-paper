S'There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in\nwait.  He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither,\nwhistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him\nand said, "Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and\ncontented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an\nalms." The huntsman took pity on the poor old creature, felt in his\npocket, and gave her what he could afford.\n\nHe was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and\nsaid, "Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you.  I will make you a\npresent in return for your good heart.  Go on your way now, but in a\nlittle while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting\nwhich have a cloak in their claws, and are fighting for it, take your\ngun and shoot into the midst of them.  They will let the cloak fall\ndown to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down\ndead.  Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak.  When you throw\nit over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain\nplace, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye.  Take out\nthe heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning\nearly, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your\npillow." The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself,\n"Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come\ntrue." And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard\nin the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he\nlooked up and saw there a swarm of birds who were tearing a piece of\ncloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as\nif each wanted to have it all to himself.  "Well," said the huntsman,\n"this is amazing, it has really come to pass just as the old crone\nforetold," and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired\nright into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about.  The\nbirds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped\ndown dead, and the cloak fell at the same time.  Then the huntsman\ndid as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the\nheart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.\n\nNext morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he\nwished to see if it also had been fulfilled.  When he lifted up the\npillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found\nanother, and so it went on, every time he got up.  He gathered\ntogether a heap of gold, but at last he thought, "Of what use is all\nmy gold to me if I stay at home?  I will go forth and see the world."\n\nHe then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman\'s pouch\nand gun, and went out into the world.  It came to pass, that one day\nhe traveled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of\nit, in the plain before him stood a fine castle.  An old woman was\nstanding with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of\nthe windows.  The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the\nmaiden, "There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful\ntreasure in his body.  We must filch it from him, daughter of my\nheart, it is more suitable for us than for him.  He has a bird\'s\nheart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning\nunder his pillow." She told her what she was to do to get it, and\nwhat part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with\nangry eyes, "And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the\nworse for you." Now when the huntsman came nearer he noticed the\nmaiden, and said to himself, "I have traveled about for such a long\ntime, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle.\nI have certainly money enough." Nevertheless, the real reason was\nthat he had caught sight of the beautiful picture.\n\nHe entered the house, and was well received and courteously\nentertained.  Before long he was so much in love with the young witch\nthat he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as\nshe saw them, and liked to do what she desired.  The old woman then\nsaid, "Now we must have the bird\'s heart, he will never miss it." She\nbrewed a potion, and when it was ready, poured it into a goblet and\ngave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the huntsman.  She\ndid so, saying, "Now, my dearest, drink to me."\n\nSo he took the goblet, and when he had swallowed the draught, he\nbrought up the heart of the bird.  The girl had to take it away\nsecretly and swallow it herself, for the old woman would have it so.\nThenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow, but it lay\ninstead under that of the maiden, from whence the old woman fetched\nit away every morning, but he was so much in love and so befooled,\nthat he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with the\ngirl.\n\nThen the old witch said, "We have the bird\'s heart, but we must also\ntake the wishing-cloak away from him." The girl answered, "We will\nleave him that, he has lost his wealth." The old woman was angry and\nsaid, "Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found\nin this world.  I must and will have it." She gave the girl several\nblows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with\nher.  So she did the old woman\'s bidding, placed herself at the\nwindow and looked on the distant country, as if she were very\nsorrowful.  The huntsman asked, "Why do you stand there so\nsorrowfully?" "Ah, my beloved," was her answer, "over yonder lies the\ngarnet mountain, where the precious stones grow.  I long for them so\nmuch that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get\nthem.  Only the birds, they fly and can reach them, but a man never."\n"Have you nothing else to complain of?" said the huntsman.  "I will\nsoon remove that burden from your heart." With that he drew her under\nhis mantle, wished himself on the garnet mountain, and in the\ntwinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together.  Precious\nstones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see\nthem, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them.\n\nNow, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the\neyes of the huntsman should become heavy.  He said to the maiden, "We\nwill sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer\nstand on my feet." Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her\nlap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle\nfrom his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets\nand stones, and wished herself back at home with them.\n\nBut when the huntsman had slept his fill and awoke, and perceived\nthat his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild\nmountain, he said, "Oh, what treachery there is in the world," and\nsat down there in trouble and sorrow, not knowing what to do.  But\nthe mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt\nthereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long before\nhe saw three of them coming towards him, so he lay down as if he were\nsunk in a deep sleep.\n\nThen the giants came up, and the first kicked him with his foot and\nsaid, "What sort of an earth-worm is this, lying here contemplating\nhis inside?" The second said, "Step upon him and kill him." But the\nthird said, contemptuously, "That would indeed be worth your while,\njust let him live, he cannot remain here, and when he climbs higher,\ntoward the summit of of the mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him\nand bear him away." So saying they passed by.  But the huntsman had\npaid heed to their words, and as soon as they were gone, he rose and\nclimbed up to the summit of the mountain, and when he had sat there a\nwhile, a cloud floated towards him, caught him up, carried him away,\nand traveled about for a long time in the heavens.  Then it sank\nlower, and let itself down on a great cabbage-garden, girt round by\nwalls, so that he came softly to the ground on cabbages and\nvegetables.\n\nThen the huntsman looked about him and said, "If I had but something\nto eat.  I am so hungry, and to proceed on my way from here will be\ndifficult.  I see here neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort\nof fruit, everywhere nothing but cabbages, but at length he thought,\nat a pinch I can eat some of the leaves, they do not taste\nparticularly good, but they will refresh me." With that he picked\nhimself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it, but scarcely had he\nswallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite\ndifferent.\n\nFour legs grew on him, a thick head and two long ears, and he saw\nwith horror that he was changed into an ass.  Still as his hunger\nincreased every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his\npresent nature, he went on eating with great zest.  At last he\narrived at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had\nswallowed it, he again felt a change, and resumed his former human\nshape.\n\nThen the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue.  When he awoke\nnext morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another\nof the good ones, and thought to himself, this shall help me to get\nmy own again and punish treachery.  Then he took the cabbages with\nhim, climbed over the wall, and went forth to look for the castle of\nhis sweetheart.  After wandering about for a couple of days he was\nlucky enough to find it again.  He dyed his face brown, so that his\nown mother would not have known him, and begged for shelter, "I am so\ntired," said he, "that I can go no further." The witch asked, "Who\nare you, countryman, and what is your business?" "I am a king\'s\nmessenger, and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which\ngrows beneath the sun.  I have even been so fortunate as to find it,\nand am carrying it about with me, but the heat of the sun is so\nintense that the delicate cabbage threatens to wither, and I do not\nknow if I can carry it any further."\n\nWhen the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and\nsaid, "Dear countryman, let me just try this wonderful salad." "Why\nnot?" answered he.  "I have brought two heads with me, and will give\nyou one of them," and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad\ncabbage.  The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so\nfor this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed\nit.  When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the\ntable, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her\nmouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her\nhuman shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an\nass.\n\nPresently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad\nstanding there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up, but on\nthe way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste,\nand she ate a couple of leaves.  Instantly the magic power showed\nitself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman,\nand the dish of salad fell to the ground.\n\nMeantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one\ncame with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, "I\ndon\'t know what has become of the salad." The huntsman thought, the\nsalad must have already taken effect, and said, "I will go to the\nkitchen and inquire about it." As he went down he saw the two asses\nrunning about in the courtyard, the salad, however, was lying on the\nground. "All right," said he, "the two have taken their portion," and\nhe picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried\nthem to the maiden.  "I bring you the delicate food myself," said he,\n"in order that you may not have to wait longer." Then she ate of it,\nand was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and\nran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass.\n\nAfter the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones\ncould recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said, "Now\nyou shall receive the wages of your treachery," and bound them\ntogether, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came\nto a mill.  He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head,\nand asked what he wanted.  "I have three unmanageable beasts,\nanswered he, which I don\'t want to keep any longer.  Will you take\nthem in, and give them food and stable room, and manage them as I\ntell you, and then I will pay you what you ask?" The miller said,\n"Why not?  But how am I to manage them?" The huntsman then said that\nhe was to give three beatings and one meal daily to the old donkey,\nand that was the witch, one beating and three meals to the younger\none, which was the servant-girl, and to the youngest, which was the\nmaiden, no beatings and three meals, for he could not bring himself\nto have the maiden beaten. After that he went back into the castle,\nand found therein everything he needed.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him\nthat the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal\ndaily was dead.  The two others, he continued, are certainly not\ndead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they\ncannot last much longer.  The huntsman was moved to pity, put away\nhis anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him.  And\nwhen they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they\nbecame human again.  The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him,\nand said, "Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you,\nmy mother drove me to it.  It was done against my will, for I love\nyou dearly.  Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the\nbird\'s-heart I will take a vomiting potion." But he thought\notherwise, and said, "Keep it.  It is all the same, for I will take\nyou for my true wife." So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived\nhappily together until their death.\n'
