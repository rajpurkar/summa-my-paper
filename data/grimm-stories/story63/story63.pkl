S"East india was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until\nhe had received six hundred dollars.  Then the townsfolk caused\nit to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to\nprocure the money should be burgomaster.  Now there was a poor\nfisherman who fished on the sea with his son, and the enemy came\nand took the son prisoner, and gave the father six hundred\ndollars for him.  So the father went and gave them to the great\nmen of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became\nburgomaster.  Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say\n'mr. Burgomaster, should be put to death on the gallows.\nThe son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great\nforest on a high mountain.  The mountain opened, and he went\ninto a great enchanted castle, wherein chairs, tables, and\nbenches were all hung with black.  Then came three young\nprincesses who were dressed entirely in black, but had a little\nwhite on their faces.  They told him he was not to be afraid,\nthey would not hurt him, and that he could rescue them.  He\nsaid he would gladly do that, if he did but know how.  At\nthis, they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them\nand also not look at them, and what he wanted to have he was\njust to ask for, and if they dared give him an answer they would\ndo so.  When he had been there for a long while he said\nhe should like to go to his father, and they told him he might\ngo.  He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this\ncoat, and in a week he must be back there again.\nThen he was lifted up, and was instantly in east india.  He could\nno longer find his father in the fisherman's hut, and asked the\npeople where the poor fisherman could be, and they told him he\nmust not say that, or he would come to the gallows.  Then he\nwent to his father and said, fisherman, how have you got here.\nThen the father said, you must not say that, if the great men\nof the town knew of that, you would come to the gallows.  He,\nhowever, would not give in, and was brought to the gallows.\nWhen he was there, he said, o, my masters, just give me leave to\ngo to the old fisherman's hut.  Then he put on his old smock, and\ncame back to the great men, and said, do you not now see.  Am I\nnot the son of the poor fisherman.  Did I not earn bread for my\nfather and mother in this dress.  Hereupon his father knew him\nagain, and begged his pardon, and took him home with him, and then\nrelated all that had happened to him, and how he had got into a\nforest on a high mountain, and the mountain had opened and he\nhad gone into an enchanted castle, where all was black, and three\nyoung princesses had come to him who were black except a little\nwhite on their faces.  And they had told him not to fear, and\nthat he could rescue them.  Then his mother said that might\nvery likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to take\na blessed candle with him, and drop some boiling wax on their\nfaces.\nHe went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped\nthe wax on their faces as they were sleeping, and they all\nturned half-white.  Then all the three princesses sprang up, and\nsaid, you accursed dog, our blood shall cry for vengeance on you.\nNow there is no man born in the world, nor will any ever be born\nwho can set us free.  We have still three brothers who are bound\nby seven chains - they shall tear you to pieces.  Then there was\na loud shrieking all over the castle, and he sprang out of the\nwindow, and broke his leg, and the castle sank into the earth\nagain, the mountain closed again, and no one knew where the castle\nhad stood.\n"
