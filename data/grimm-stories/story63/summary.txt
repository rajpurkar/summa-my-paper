A fisherman becomes burgomaster of a town in East India after he receives six hundred dollars for his son. The son escapes from his captor and discovers an enchanted castle with three black princesses. He can free them from their spell if he does exactly what they tell him. Instead, the boy takes his mother's advice and drops hot candle wax on each of the princesses' faces. The girls turn half white. His actions doom them to be cursed forever. In fear, the boy jumps out of the window and breaks his leg. The castle sinks into the ground and is never seen again.
