S"There was once a man who had a daughter who was called clever\nelsie.  And when she had grown up her father said, we will get\nher married.  Yes, said the mother, if only someone would come who\nwould have her.  At length a man came from a distance and wooed\nher, who was called Hans, but he stipulated that clever elsie\nshould be really smart.  Oh, said the father, she has plenty of\ngood sense.  And the mother said, oh, she can see the wind coming\nup the street, and hear the flies coughing.\n\nWell, said Hans, if she is not really smart, I won't have her.\nWhen they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said,\nelsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.  Then clever elsie\ntook the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped\nthe lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear\nlong.  When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set\nit before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did\nnot hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury.  Then she\nplaced the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the\nbeer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked\nup at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\npick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally\nleft there.\n\nThen clever elsie began to weep, and said, if I get Hans, and we\nhave a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar\nhere to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and\nkill him.  Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength\nof her body, over the misfortune which lay before her.  Those\nupstairs waited for the drink, but clever elsie still did not\ncome.  Then the woman said to the servant, just go down into the\ncellar and see where elsie is.  The maid went and found her\nsitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly.  Elsie, why do\nyou weep, asked the maid.  Ah, she answered, have I not reason\nto weep.  If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big,\nand has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his\nhead, and kill him.  Then said the maid, what a clever elsie we\nhave.  And sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the\nmisfortune.  After a while, as the maid did not come back, those\nupstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy, just\ngo down into the cellar and see where elsie and the girl are.\n\nThe boy went down, and there sat clever elsie and the girl both\nweeping together.  Then he asked, why are you weeping,  ah, said\nelsie, have I not reason to weep.  If I get Hans, and we have a\nchild, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe\nwill fall on his head and kill him.  Then said the boy, what a\nclever elsie we have.  And sat down by her, and likewise began\nto howl loudly.  Upstairs they\nwaited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said\nto the woman, just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is.\n\nThe woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their\nlamentations, and inquired what was the cause, then elsie told\nher also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe,\nwhen it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell\ndown.  Then said the mother likewise, what a clever elsie we have.\nAnd sat down and wept with them.  The man upstairs waited a short\ntime, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever\ngreater, he said, I must go into the cellar myself and see where\nelsie is.  But when he got into the cellar, and they were all\nsitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that elsie's\nchild was the cause, and that elsie might perhaps bring one into\nthe world some day, and that he might be killed by the\npick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing\nbeer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried, oh,\nwhat a clever elsie.  And sat down, and likewise wept with them.\n\nThe bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for a long time, then as\nno one would come back he thought, they must be waiting for me\nbelow, I too must go there and see what they are about.  When he\ngot down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\nquite piteously, each out-doing the other.  What misfortune has\nhappened then, he asked.  Ah, dear Hans, said elsie, if we marry\neach other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send\nhim here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has\nbeen left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall\ndown, so have we not reason to weep.  Come, said Hans, more\nunderstanding than that is not needed for my household, as you\nare such a clever elsie, I will have you.  And he seized her\nhand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\n\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said, wife, I am going\nout to work and earn some money for us, go into the field and cut\nthe corn that we may have some bread.  Yes, dear Hans, I will do\nthat.  After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good\nbroth and took it into the field with her.  When she came to the\nfield she said to herself, what shall I do, shall I cut first, or\nshall I eat first.  Oh, I will eat first.  Then she drank her cup\nof broth, and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said,\nwhat shall I do.  Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first.  I\nwill sleep first.  Then she lay down among the corn and fell\nasleep.  Hans had been at home for a long time, but elsie did not\ncome, then said he, what a clever elsie I have, she is so\nindustrious that she does not even come home to eat.  But when\nevening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what\nshe had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the\ncorn asleep.  Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler's net\nwith little bells and hung it round about her, and she still\nwent on sleeping.  Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\ndown in his chair and worked.  At length, when it was quite dark,\nclever elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all\nround about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took.\nThen she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was\nclever elsie or not, and said, is it I, or is it not I.  But she\nknew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in\ndoubt, at length she thought, I will go home and ask if it be I,\nor if it be not I, they will be sure to know.  She ran to the door\nof her own house, but it was shut, then she knocked at the\nwindow and cried, Hans, is elsie within.  Yes, answered Hans, she\nis within.  Hereupon she was terrified, and said, ah, heavens.\nThen it is not I.  And went to another door, but when the people\nheard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\ncould get in nowhere.  Then she ran out of the village, and no\none has seen her since.\n"
