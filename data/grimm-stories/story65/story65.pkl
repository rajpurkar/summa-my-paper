S'\tLittle Red-Cap\n\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved\nby every one who looked at her, but most of all by her\ngrandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have\ngiven to the child.  Once she gave her a little cap of red\nvelvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear\nanything else.  So she was always called little red-cap.\n\nOne day her mother said to her, come, little red-cap, here\nis a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.  Take them to your\ngrandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.\nSet out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk\nnicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may\nfall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\nget nothing.  And when you go into her room, don\'t forget\nto say, good-morning, and don\'t peep into every corner before\nyou do it.\n\nI will take great care, said little red-cap to her mother, and\ngave her hand on it.\n\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the\nvillage, and just as little red-cap entered the wood, a wolf\nmet her.  Red-cap did not know what a wicked creature he was,\nand was not at all afraid of him.\n\n"Good-day, little red-cap," said he.\n\n"Thank you kindly, wolf."\n\n"Whither away so early, little red-cap?"\n\n"To my grandmother\'s."\n\n"What have you got in your apron?"\n\n"Cake and wine.  Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick\ngrandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."\n\n"Where does your grandmother live, little red-cap?"\n\n"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood.  Her house\nstands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just\nbelow.  You surely must know it," replied little red-cap.\n\nThe wolf thought to himself, what a tender young creature.  What a\nnice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old\nwoman.  I must act craftily, so as to catch both.  So he walked\nfor a short time by the side of little red-cap, and then he\nsaid, "see little red-cap, how pretty the flowers are about here.\nWhy do you not look round.  I believe, too, that you do not\nhear how sweetly the little birds are singing.  You walk gravely\nalong as if you were going to school, while everything else out\nhere in the wood is merry."\n\nLittle red-cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams\ndancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers\ngrowing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a\nfresh nosegay.  That would please her too.  It is so early in the\nday that I shall still get there in good time.  And so she ran\nfrom the path into the wood to look for flowers.  And whenever\nshe had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one\nfarther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into\nthe wood.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\'s house and\nknocked at the door.\n\n"Who is there?"\n\n"Little red-cap," replied the wolf.  "She is bringing cake and\nwine.  Open the door."\n\n"Lift the latch," called out the grandmother, "I am too weak, and\ncannot get up."\n\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without\nsaying a word he went straight to the grandmother\'s bed, and\ndevoured her.  Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in\nher cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n\nLittle red-cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry\nno more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the\nway to her.\n\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and\nwhen she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that\nshe said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at\nother times I like being with grandmother so much.  She called\nout, "good morning," but received no answer.  So she went to the\nbed and drew back the curtains.  There lay her grandmother with\nher cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n\n"Oh, grandmother," she said, "what big ears you have."\n\n"The better to hear you with, my child," was the reply.\n\n"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have," she said.\n\n"The better to see you with," my dear.\n\n"But, grandmother, what large hands you have."\n\n"The better to hug you with."\n\n"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have."\n\n"The better to eat you with."\n\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was\nout of bed and swallowed up red-cap.\n\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in\nthe bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.  The\nhuntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how\nthe old woman is snoring.  I must just see if she wants anything.\n\nSo he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw\nthat the wolf was lying in it.  Do I find you here, you old\nsinner, said he.  I have long sought you.  Then just as he was going\nto fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so\nhe did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut\nopen the stomach of the sleeping wolf.  When he had made two\nsnips, he saw the little red-cap shining, and then he made two\nsnips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, ah, how\nfrightened I have been.  How dark it was inside the wolf.  And\nafter that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely\nable to breathe.  Red-cap, however, quickly\nfetched great stones with which they filled the wolf\'s belly, and\nwhen he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so\nheavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n\nThen all three were delighted.  The huntsman drew off the wolf\'s\nskin and went home with it.  The grandmother ate the cake and\ndrank the wine which red-cap had brought, and revived, but\nred-cap thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by\nmyself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has\nforbidden me to do so.\n\nIt is also related that once when red-cap was again taking cakes\nto the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to\nentice her from the path.  Red-cap, however, was on her guard,\nand went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother\nthat she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to\nher, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had\nnot been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten\nher up.  Well, said the grandmother, we will shut the door, that\nhe may not come in.  Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried,\nopen the door, grandmother, I am little red-cap, and am bringing\nyou some cakes.  But they did not speak, or open the door, so\nthe grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last\njumped on the roof, intending to wait until red-cap went home in\nthe evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the\ndarkness.  But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.  In\nfront of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the\nchild, take the pail, red-cap.  I made some sausages yesterday,\nso carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.  Red-cap\ncarried until the great trough was quite full.   Then the smell\nof the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped\ndown, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could\nno longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down\nfrom the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.\nBut red-cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything\nto harm her again.\n'
