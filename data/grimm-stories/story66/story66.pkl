S'There was once an old castle in the midst of a large and dense\nforest, and in it an old woman who was a witch dwelt all\nalone.  In the day-time she changed herself into a car or a\nscreech-owl, but in the evening she took her proper shape\nagain as a human being.  She could lure wild beasts and birds\nto her, and then she killed and boiled and roasted them.  If\nanyone came within one hundred paces of the castle he was\nobliged to stand still, and could not stir from the place until\nshe bade him be free.  But whenever an innocent maiden came\nwithin this circle, she changed her into a bird, and shut her\nup in a wicker-work cage, and carried the cage into a room in the\ncastle.  She had about seven thousand cages of rare birds in\nthe castle.\nNow, there was once a maiden who was called jorinda, who was\nfairer than all other girls.  She and a handsome youth named\njoringel had promised to marry each other.  They were still in\nthe days of betrothal, and their greatest happiness was being\ntogether.  One day in order that they might be able to talk\ntogether in peace they went for a walk in the forest.  Take\ncare, said joringel, that you do not go too near the castle.\nIt was a beautiful evening.  The sun shone brightly between\nthe trunks of the trees into the dark green of the forest, and\nthe turtle-doves sang mournfully upon the beech trees.\nJorinda wept now and then.  She sat down in the sunshine and\nwas sorrowful.  Joringel was sorrowful too.  They were as\nsad as if they were about to die.  Then they looked around them,\nand were quite at a loss, for they did not know by which way\nthey should go home.  The sun was still half above the\nmountain and half under.\nJoringel looked through the bushes, and saw the old walls of the\ncastle close at hand.  He was horror-stricken and filled with\ndeadly fear.  Jorinda was singing,\n          my little bird, with the necklace red,\n          sings sorrow, sorrow, sorrow,\n          he sings that the dove must soon be dead,\n          sings sorrow, sor - jug, jug, jug.\nJoringel looked for jorinda.  She was changed into a nightingale,\nand sang, jug, jug, jug.  A screech-owl with glowing eyes\nflew three times round about her, and three times cried, to-whoo,\nto-whoo, to-whoo.\nJoringel could not move.  He stood there like a stone, and\ncould neither weep nor speak, nor move hand or foot.\nThe sun had now set.  The owl flew into the thicket, and directly\nafterwards there came out of it a crooked old woman, yellow\nand lean, with large red eyes and a hooked nose, the point of\nwhich reached to her chin.  She muttered to herself, caught the\nnightingale, and took it away in her hand.\nJoringel could neither speak nor move from the spot.  The\nnightingale was gone.  At last the woman came back, and said\nin a hollow voice, greet you, zachiel.  If the moon shines on\nthe cage, zachiel, let him loose at once.  Then joringel was\nfreed.  He fell on his knees before the woman and begged that\nshe would give him back his jorinda, but she said that he\nshould never have her again, and went away.  He called, he wept,\nhe lamented, but all in vain, hooh, what is to become of me.\nJoringel went away, and at last came to a strange village, where\nhe kept sheep for a long time.  He often walked round and round\nthe castle, but not too near to it.  At last he dreamt one\nnight that he found a blood-red flower, in the middle of\nwhich was a beautiful large pearl.  That he picked the flower\nand went with it to the castle, and that everything he touched\nwith the flower was freed from enchantment.  He also dreamt\nthat by means of it he recovered his jorinda.\nIn the morning, when he awoke, he began to seek over hill and\ndale for such a flower.  He sought until the ninth day, and then,\nearly in the morning, he found the blood-red flower.  In the\nmiddle of it there was a large dew-drop, as big as the finest\npearl.\nDay and night he journeyed with this flower to the castle.  When\nhe was within a hundred paces of it he was not held fast, but\nwalked on to the door.  Joringel was full of joy.  He touched the\ndoor with the flower, and it sprang open.  He walked in through\nthe courtyard, and listened for the sound of the birds.  At\nlast he heard it.  He went on and found the room from whence it\ncame, and there the witch was feeding the birds in the seven\nthousand cages.\nWhen she saw joringel she was angry, very angry, and scolded\nand spat poison and gall at him, but she could not come within\ntwo paces of him.  He did not take any notice of her, but went\nand looked at the cages with the birds.  But there were many\nhundred nightingales, how was he to find his jorinda again.\nJust then he saw the old woman quietly take away a cage with\na bird in it, and go towards the door.\nSwiftly he sprang towards her, touched the cage with the flower,\nand also the old woman.  She could now no longer bewitch anyone.\nAnd jorinda was standing there, clasping him round the neck,\nand she was as beautiful as ever.  Then all the other birds\nwere turned into maidens again, and he went home with his jorinda,\nand they lived happily together for a long time.\n'
