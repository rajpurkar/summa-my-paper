S"There was a certain merchant who had two children, a boy and a girl,\nthey were both young, and could not walk.  And two richly-laden ships\nof his sailed forth to sea with all his property on board, and just\nas he was expecting to win much money by them, news came that they\nhad gone to the bottom, and now instead of being a rich man he was a\npoor one, and had nothing left but one field outside the town.  In\norder to drive his misfortune a little out of his thoughts, he went\nout to this field, and as he was walking to and fro in it, a little\nblack mannikin stood suddenly by his side, and asked why he was so\nsad, and what he was taking so much to heart.\n\nThen said the merchant, if you could help me I would willingly tell\nyou.  Who knows, replied the black dwarf.  Perhaps, I can help you.\nThen the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the\nbottom of the sea, and that he had nothing left but this field.  Do\nnot trouble yourself, said the dwarf.  If you will promise to give me\nthe first thing that rubs itself against your leg when you are at\nhome again, and to bring it here to this place in twelve years, time,\nyou shall have as much money as you will. The merchant thought, what\ncan that be but my dog, and did not remember his little boy, so he\nsaid yes, gave the black man a written and sealed promise, and went\nhome.\n\nWhen he reached home, his little boy was so delighted that he held\nhimself by a bench, trotted up to him and seized him fast by the\nlegs.  The father was shocked, for he remembered his promise, and now\nknew what he had pledged himself to do, as however, he still found no\nmoney in his chest, he thought the dwarf had only been jesting.  A\nmonth afterwards he went up to the garret, intending to gather\ntogether some old tin and to sell it, and saw lying there a great\nheap of money.  Then he was happy again, made purchases, became a\ngreater merchant than before, and felt that God was good to him.  In\nthe meantime the boy grew tall, and at the same time bright and\nclever.  But the nearer the twelfth year approached the more anxious\ngrew the merchant, so that his distress might be seen in his face.\nOne day his son asked what ailed him, but the father would not say.\nThe boy, however, persisted so long, that at last he told him that\nwithout being aware of what he was doing, he had promised him to a\nblack dwarf, and had received much money for doing so.  He said\nlikewise that he had set his hand and seal to this, and that now when\ntwelve years had gone by he would have to give him up.\n\nThen said the son, oh, father, do not be uneasy, all will go well.\nThe black man has no power over me.  The son had himself blessed by\nthe priest, and when the time came, father and son went together to\nthe field, and the son made a circle and placed himself inside it\nwith his father.  Then came the black dwarf and said to the old man,\nhave you brought with you that which you have promised me.  He was\nsilent, but the son asked, what do you want here?  Then said the\nblack dwarf, I have to speak with your father, and not with you.  The\nson replied, you have betrayed and misled my father, give back the\nwriting.  No, said the black dwarf, I will not give up my rights.\nThey spoke together for a long time after this, but at last they\nagreed that the son, as he did not belong to the enemy of mankind,\nnor yet to his father, should seat himself in a small boat, which\nshould lie on water which was flowing away from them, and that the\nfather should push it off with his own foot, and then the son should\nremain given up to the water.  So he took leave of his father, placed\nhimself in a little boat, and the father had to push it off with his\nown foot.  The boat capsized so that the keel was uppermost and the\ndeck under water, and the father believed his son was lost, and went\nhome and mourned for him.\n\nThe boat, however, did not sink, but floated quietly away, and the\nboy sat safely inside it, and it floated thus for a long time, until\nat last it ran into an unknown shore.  Then he landed and saw a\nbeautiful castle before him, and set out to go to it.  But when he\nentered it, he found that it was bewitched.  He went through every\nroom, but all were empty until he reached the last, where a snake lay\ncoiled in a ring.  The snake, however, was an enchanted maiden, who\nrejoiced to see him, and said, have you come, oh, my deliverer.  I\nhave already waited twelve years for you, this kingdom is bewitched,\nand you must set it free.  How can I do that, he inquired.  To-night\ncome twelve black men, covered with chains who will ask what you are\ndoing here, but be silent, give them no answer, and let them do what\nthey will with you, they will torment you, beat you, stab you, let\neverything pass, only do not speak, at twelve o'clock, they must go\naway again.  On the second night twelve others will come, on the\nthird, four-and-twenty, who will cut off your head, but at twelve\no'clock their power will be over, and then if you have endured all,\nand have not spoken the slightest word, I shall be released.  I will\ncome to you, and will have, in a bottle, some of the water of life.\nI will rub you with that, and then you will come to life again, and\nbe as healthy as before.  Then said he, I will gladly set you free.\nAnd everything happened just as she had said, the black men could not\nforce a single word from him, and on the third night the snake became\na beautiful princess, who came with the water of life and brought him\nback to life again.\n\nSo she threw herself into his arms and kissed him, and there was joy\nand gladness in the whole castle.  After this their marriage was\ncelebrated, and he was king of the golden mountain.\n\nThey lived very happily together, and the queen bore a fine boy.\nEight years had already gone by, when the king bethought him of his\nfather, his heart was moved, and he wished to visit him. The queen,\nhowever, would not let him go away, and said, I know beforehand that\nit will cause my unhappiness, but he suffered her to have no rest\nuntil she consented.  At their parting she gave him a wishing-ring,\nand said, take this ring and put it on your finger, and then you will\nimmediately be transported whithersoever you would be, only you must\npromise me not to use it in wishing me away from this place and with\nthy father.  That he promised her, put the ring on his finger, and\nwished himself at home, just outside the town where his father lived.\nInstantly he found himself there, and made for the town, but when he\ncame to the gate, the sentries would not let him in, because he wore\nsuch strange and yet such rich and magnificent clothing.  Then he\nwent to a hill where a shepherd was watching his sheep, changed\nclothes with him, put on his old shepherd's-coat, and then entered\nthe town without hindrance.\n\nWhen he came to his father, he made himself known to him, but he did\nnot at all believe that the shepherd was his son, and said he\ncertainly had had a son, but that he was dead long ago, however, as\nhe saw he was a poor, needy shepherd, he would give him something to\neat.  Then the shepherd said to his parents, I am verily your son.\nDo you know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me.\nYes, said his mother, our son had a raspberry mark under his right\narm.  He slipped back his shirt, and they saw the raspberry under his\nright arm, and no longer doubted that he was their son.  Then he told\nthem that he was king of the golden mountain, and a king's daughter\nwas his wife, and that they had a fine son of seven years old.\n\nThen said the father, that is certainly not true, it is a fine kind\nof a king who goes about in a ragged shepherd's-coat.  On this the\nson fell in a passion, and without thinking of his promise, turned\nhis ring round, and wished both his wife and child with him.  They\nwere there in a second, but the queen wept, and reproached him, and\nsaid that he had broken his word, and had brought misfortune upon\nher.  He said, I have done it thoughtlessly, and not with evil\nintention, and tried to calm her, and she pretended to believe this,\nbut she had mischief in her mind.\n\nThen he led her out of the town into the field, and showed her the\nstream where the little boat had been pushed off, and then he said, I\nam tired, sit down, I will sleep awhile on your lap. And he laid his\nhead on her lap, and she picked his lice for a while until he fell\nasleep.  When he was asleep, she first drew the ring from his finger,\nthen she drew away the foot which was under him, leaving only the\nslipper behind her, and she took her child in her arms, and wished\nherself back in her own kingdom.\n\nWhen he awoke, there he lay quite deserted, and his wife and child\nwere gone, and so was the ring from his finger, the slipper only was\nstill there as a token.  Home to your parents you cannot return,\nthought he, they would say that you were a wizard, you must be off,\nand walk on until you arrive in your own kingdom.  So he went away\nand came at length to a hill by which three giants were standing,\ndisputing with each other because they did not know how to divide\ntheir father's property.\n\nWhen they saw him passing by, they called to him and said little men\nhad quick wits, and that he was to divide their inheritance for them.\nThe inheritance, however, consisted of a sword, which, if anyone took\nit in his hand, and said, all heads off but mine, every head would\nlie on the ground, secondly, of a cloak which made any one who put it\non invisible, thirdly, of a pair of boots which could transport the\nwearer to any place he wished in a moment.  He said, give me the\nthree things that I may see if they are still in good condition.\n\nThey gave him the cloak, and when he had put it on, he was invisible\nand changed into a fly.  Then he resumed his own form and said, the\ncloak is a good one, now give me the sword.  They said, no, we will\nnot give you that, if you were to say, all heads off but mine, all\nour heads would be off, and you alone would be left with yours.\nNevertheless they gave it to him on the condition that he was only to\ntry it against a tree.  This he did, and the sword cut in two the\ntrunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw.  Then he wanted\nto have the boots likewise, but they said, no, we will not give them,\nif you had them on your feet and were to wish yourself at the top of\nthe hill, we should be left down here with nothing.  Oh, no, said he,\nI will not do that.  So they gave him the boots as well.  And now\nwhen he had got all these things, he thought of nothing but his wife\nand his child, and said as though to himself, oh, if I were but on\nthe golden mountain, and at the same moment he vanished from the\nsight of the giants, and thus their inheritance was divided.\n\nWhen he was near his palace, he heard sounds of joy, and fiddles, and\nflutes, and the people told him that his wife was celebrating her\nwedding with another.  Then he fell into a rage, and said, false\nwoman, she betrayed and deserted me whilst I was asleep.  So he put\non his cloak, and unseen by all went into the palace.  When he\nentered the dining-hall a great table was spread with delicious food,\nand the guests were eating and drinking, and laughing, and jesting.\nShe sat on a royal seat in the midst of them in splendid apparel,\nwith a crown on her head.\n\nHe placed himself behind her, and no one saw him.  When she put a\npiece of meat on a plate for herself, he took it away and ate it, and\nwhen she poured out a glass of wine for herself, he took it away and\ndrank it.  She was always helping herself to something, and yet she\nnever got anything, for plate and glass disappeared immediately.\nThen dismayed and ashamed, she arose and went to her chamber and\nwept, but he followed her there.  She said, has the devil power over\nme, or did my deliverer never come?  Then he struck her in the face,\nand said, did your deliverer never come.  It is he who has you in his\npower, you traitor.  Have I deserved this from you.\n\nThen he made himself visible, went into the hall, and cried, the\nwedding is at an end, the true king has returned.  The kings,\nprinces, and councillors who were assembled there, ridiculed and\nmocked him, but he did not trouble to answer them, and said, will you\ngo away, or not.  On this they tried to seize him and pressed upon\nhim, but he drew his sword and said, all heads off but mine, and all\nthe heads rolled on the ground, and he alone was master, and once\nmore king of the golden mountain.\n"
