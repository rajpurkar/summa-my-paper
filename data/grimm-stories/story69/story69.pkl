S"There was once on a time a mother who had three daughters,\nthe eldest of whom was rude and wicked, the second much better,\nalthough she had her faults, but the youngest was a pious, good\nchild.  The mother, however, was so strange, that it was just\nthe eldest daughter whom she most loved, and she could not bear\nthe youngest.  On this account, she often sent the poor girl\nout into the great forest in order to get rid of her, for she\nthought she would lose herself and never come back again.  But\nthe guardian-angel which every good child has, did not forsake\nher, but always brought her into the right path again.  Once,\nhowever, the guardian-angel behaved as if he were not there,\nand the child could not find her way out of the forest again.\nShe walked on constantly until evening came, and then she saw\na tiny light burning in the distance, ran up to it at once,\nand came to a little hut.  She knocked, the door opened, and\nshe came to a second door, where she knocked again.  An old man,\nwho had a snow-white beard and looked venerable, opened it\nfor her.  And he was no other than St. Joseph.  He said quite\nkindly, come, dear child, seat yourself on my little chair by\nthe fire, and warm yourself.  I will fetch you clear water if\nyou are thirsty.  But here in the forest, I have nothing for\nyou to eat but a couple of little roots, which you must first\nscrape and boil.\nSt. Joseph gave her the roots.  The girl scraped them clean, then\nshe brought a piece of pancake and the bread that her mother\nhad given her to take with her, mixed all together in a pan, and\ncooked herself a thick soup.  When it was ready, St. Joseph said,\nI am so hungry, give me some of your food.  The child was quite\nwilling, and gave him more than she kept for herself, but God's\nblessing\nwas with her, so that she was satisfied.  When they had eaten,\nSt. Joseph said, now we will go to bed.  I have, however, only\none bed, lay your self in it.  I will lie on the ground on the\nstraw.  No, answered she, stay in your own bed, the straw is\nsoft enough for me.  But St. Joseph took the child in his arms,\nand carried her into the little bed, and there she said her\nprayers, and fell asleep.  Next morning when she awoke, she\nwanted to say good morning to St. Joseph, but she did not see him.\nThen she got up and looked for him, but could not find him\nanywhere.  At last she perceived, behind the door, a bag with\nmoney so heavy that she could just carry it, and on it was\nwritten that it was for the child who had slept there that night.\nOn this she took the bag, bounded away with it, and got\nsafely to her mother, and as she gave her mother all the money,\nshe could not help being satisfied with her.\nThe next day, the second child also took a fancy to go into\nthe forest.  Her mother gave her a much larger piece of pancake\nand bread.  It happened with her just as with the first child.\nIn the evening she came to St. Joseph's little hut, who gave her\nroots for a thick soup.  When it was ready, he likewise said\nto her, I am so hungry, give me some of your food.  Then the\nchild said, you may have your share.  Afterwards, when St.\nJoseph offered her his bed and wanted to lie on the straw, she\nreplied, no, lie down in the bed, there is plenty of room for\nboth of us.  St. Joseph took her in his arms and put her in the\nbed, and laid himself on the straw.\nIn the morning when the child awoke and looked for St. Joseph,\nhe had vanished, but behind the door she found a little sack\nof money that was about as long as a hand, and on it was\nwritten that it was for the child who had slept there last\nnight.  So she took the little bag and ran home with it, and\ntook it to her mother, but she secretly kept two pieces for\nherself.\nThe eldest daughter had by this time grown inquisitive, and the\nnext morning also insisted on going out into the forest.  Her\nmother gave her pancakes - as many as she wanted, and bread\nand cheese as well.  In the evening she found St. Joseph in his\nlittle hut, just as the two others had found him.  When the\nsoup was ready\nand St. Joseph said, I am so hungry, give me some of the food,\nthe girl answered, wait until I am satisfied, then if there is\nanything left you shall have it.  But she ate nearly the\nwhole of it, and St. Joseph had to scrape the dish.  Afterwards,\nthe good old man offered her his bed, and wanted to lie on\nthe straw.  She took it without making any opposition, laid\nherself down in the little bed, and left the hard straw to the\nwhite-haired man.  Next morning when she awoke, St. Joseph was\nnot to be found, but she did not trouble herself about that.  She\nlooked behind the door for a money-bag.  She fancied something\nwas lying on the ground, but as she could not very well distinguish\nwhat it was, she stooped down, so that she touched it with her\nnose, where it remained hanging, and when she got up again,\nshe saw, to her horror, that it was a second nose, which was\nhanging fast to her own.  Then she began to scream and howl,\nbut that did no good.  She always had to look at her nose, for\nit stretched out so far.  Then she ran out and screamed without\nstopping till she met St. Joseph, at whose feet she fell and begged\nuntil, out of pity, he took the nose off her again, and even\ngave her two farthings.  When she got home, her mother was standing\nbefore the door, and asked, what have you had given to you.  Then\nshe\nlied and said, a great bag of money, but I have lost it on the way.\nLost it. Cried the mother.  Oh, but we will soon find it again,\nand took her by the hand, and wanted to seek it with her.  At\nfirst she began to cry, and did not wish to go, but at last she\nwent.  On the way, however, so many lizards and snakes broke\nloose on both of them, that they did not know how to save\nthemselves.  At last they stung the wicked child to death, and\nthey stung the mother in the foot, because she had not brought\nher up better.\n"
