S"A poor man had twelve children and was forced to work night and\nday to give them even bread.  When therefore the thirteenth\ncame into the world, he knew not what to do in his trouble,\nbut ran out into the great highway, and resolved to ask the\nfirst person whom he met to be godfather.  The first to meet\nhim was the good God who already knew what filled his heart,\nand said to him, poor man, I pity you.  I will hold your child\nat its christening, and will take charge of it and make it\nhappy on earth.  The man said, who are you.  I am God.  Then\nI do not desire to have you for a godfather, said the man, you give\nto the rich, and leave the poor to hunger.  Thus spoke the man,\nfor he did not know how wisely God apportions riches and\npoverty.  He turned therefore away from the Lord, and went\nfarther.  Then the devil came to him and said, what do you seek.\nIf you will take me as a godfather for your child, I will give him\ngold in plenty and all the joys of the world as well.  The man\nasked, who are you.  I am the devil.  Then I do not desire to have\nyou for godfather, said the man, you deceive men and lead them\nastray.  He went onwards, and then came death striding up to\nhim with withered legs, and said, take me as godfather.  The\nman asked, who are you.  I am death, and I make all equal.  Then\nsaid the man,\nyou are the right one, you take the rich as well as the poor,\nwithout distinction, you shall be godfather.  Death answered,\nI will make your child rich and famous, for he who has me for a\nfriend can lack nothing.  The man said, next sunday is the\nchristening, be there at the right time.  Death appeared as he\nhad promised, and stood godfather quite in the usual way.\nWhen the boy had grown up, his godfather one day appeared\nand bade him go with him.  He led him forth into a forest, and\nshowed him a herb which grew there, and said, now you shall\nreceive your godfather's present.  I make you a celebrated\nphysician.  When you are called to a patient, I will always appear\nto you.  If I stand by the head of the sick man, you may say with\nconfidence that you will make him well again, and if you give\nhim of this herb he will recover, but if I stand by the patient's\nfeet, he is mine, and you must say that all remedies are in\nvain, and that no physician in the world could save him.  But\nbeware of using the herb against my will, or it might fare\nill with you.\n\nIt was not long before the youth was the most famous physician\nin the whole world.  He had only to look at the patient and he\nknew his condition at once, whether he would recover, or must\nneeds die.  So they said of him, and from far and wide people\ncame to him, sent for him when they had anyone ill, and gave him\nso much money that he soon became a rich man.  Now it so befell\nthat the king became ill, and the physician was summoned, and\nwas to say if recovery were possible.  But when he came to the bed,\ndeath was standing by the feet of the sick man, and the herb\ndid not grow which could save him.  If I could but cheat death for\nonce, thought the physician, he is sure to take it ill if I do\nbut, as I am his godson, he will shut one eye, I will risk it.  He\ntherefore took up the sick man, and laid him the other way, so\nthat now death was standing by his head.  Then he gave the king\nsome of the herbs, and he recovered and grew healthy again.\n\nBut death came to the physician, looking very black and\nangry, threatened him with his finger, and said, you have betrayed\nme, this time I will pardon\nit, as you are my godson, but if you venture it again, it\nwill cost you your neck, for I will take you yourself away\nwith me.\n\nSoon afterwards the king's daughter fell into a severe illness.\nShe was his only child, and he wept day and night, so that he\nbegan to lose the sight of his eyes, and he caused it to be\nmade known that whosoever rescued her from death should be her\nhusband and inherit the crown.  When the physician came to the\nsick girl's bed, he saw death by her feet.  He ought to have\nremembered the warning given by his godfather, but he was so\ninfatuated by the great beauty of the king's daughter, and the\nhappiness of becoming her husband, that he flung all thought to\nthe winds.  He did not see that death was casting angry glances\non him, that he was raising his hand in the air, and threatening\nhim with his withered fist.  He raised up the sick girl,\nand placed her head where her feet had lain.  Then he gave\nher some of the herb, and instantly her cheeks flushed red,\nand life stirred afresh in her.\n\nWhen death saw that for a second time his own property had been\nmisused, he walked up to the physician with long strides, and\nsaid, all is over with you, and now the lot falls on you, and\nseized him so firmly with his ice-cold hand, that he could not\nresist, and led him into a cave below the earth.  There he\nsaw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in\ncountless rows, some large, some medium-sized, others small.\nEvery instant some were extinguished, and others again burnt up,\nso that the flames seemed to leap hither and thither in\nperpetual change.  See, said death, these are the lights of\nmen's lives.  The large ones belong to children, the medium-sized\nones to married people in their prime, the little ones belong\nto old people, but children and young folks likewise have\noften only a tiny candle.  Show me the light of my life, said\nthe physician, and he thought that it would be still very\ntall.  Death pointed to a little end which was just threatening\nto go out, and said, behold, it is there.  Ah, dear godfather,\nsaid the horrified physician, light a new one for me, do it for\nlove of me, that I may enjoy my life, be king, and the husband of\nthe king's beautiful daughter.  I cannot, answered death,\none must go out\nbefore a new one is lighted.  Then place the old one on a new\none, that will go on burning at once when the old one has come\nto an end, pleaded the physician.  Death behaved as if he were\ngoing to fulfill his wish, and took hold of a tall new candle,\nbut as he desired to revenge himself, he purposely made a mistake\nin fixing it, and the little piece fell down and was extinguished.\nImmediately the physician fell on the ground, and now he himself\nwas in the hands of death.\n"
