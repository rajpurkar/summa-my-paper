A man seeks a godfather for his thirteenth child. Death proposes to be godfather, a proposal the father accepts because death makes all people equal. The godfather gives his godson a gift of an herb that will cure people. The godson misuses these herbs twice and death takes the godson to a cave beneath the earth and shows him the light of men's lives. Although the godson pleads for his life, godfather death fumbles his light and the godson dies.
