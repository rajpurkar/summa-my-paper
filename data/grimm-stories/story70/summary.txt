In olden times, hundreds of kernels of corn grew on one stalk instead of the fifty or sixty that grow today. One day the Lord witnessed a woman thoughtlessly tear off a handful of ears of corn to clean her child's dress. At that time the Lord commanded no more corn would grow. When the people prayed and begged for corn for food, the Lord allowed corn to grow, but only in the scanty ears on which it grows today.
