S"There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain\nwished for a child.  At length the woman hoped that God\nwas about to grant her desire.  These people had a little\nwindow at the back of their house from which a splendid garden\ncould be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and\nherbs.  It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one\ndared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world.  One day the woman\nwas standing by this window and looking down into the garden,\nwhen she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful\nrampion - rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she\nlonged for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.  This desire\nincreased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any\nof it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.\nThen her husband was alarmed, and asked, what ails you, dear\nwife.  Ah, she replied, if I can't eat some of the rampion, which\nis in the garden behind our house, I shall die.  The man, who loved\nher, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of\nthe rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.  At twilight, he\nclambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress,\nhastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.  She\nat once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.  It tasted\nso good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it\nthree times as much as before.  If he was to have any rest, her\nhusband must once more descend into the garden.  In the gloom of\nevening, therefore, he let himself down again.  But when he had\nclambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the\nenchantress standing before him.  How can you dare, said she with\nangry look, descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a\nthief.  You shall suffer for it.  Ah, answered he, let mercy take\nthe place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of\nnecessity.  My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such\na longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some\nto eat.  Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and\nsaid to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take\naway with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring\ninto the world.  It shall be well treated, and I will care for it\nlike a mother.  The man in his terror consented to everything, and\nwhen the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once,\ngave the child the name of rapunzel, and took it away with her.\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.\nWhen she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a\ntower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but\nquite at the top was a little window.  When the enchantress\nwanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair to me.\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when\nshe heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided\ntresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above,\nand then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed\nup by it.\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode\nthrough the forest and passed by the tower.  Then he heard a song,\nwhich was so charming that he stood still and listened.  This was\nrapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet\nvoice resound.  The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and\nlooked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.  He\nrode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that\nevery day he went out into the forest and listened to it.  Once when\nhe was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress\ncame there, and he heard how she cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair.\nThen rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the\nenchantress climbed up to her.  If that is the ladder by which one\nmounts, I too will try my fortune, said he, and the next day when\nit began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair.\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up.\nAt first rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as\nher eyes had never yet beheld, came to her.  But the king's son\nbegan to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his\nheart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he\nhad been forced to see her.  Then rapunzel lost her fear, and when\nhe asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that\nhe was young and handsome, she thought, he will love me more than\nold dame gothel does.  And she said yes, and laid her hand in his.\nShe said, I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know\nhow to get down.  Bring with you a skein of silk every time that\nyou come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready\nI will descend, and you will take me on your horse.  They agreed\nthat until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\nold woman came by day.  The enchantress remarked nothing of\nthis, until once rapunzel said to her, tell me, dame gothel, how\nit happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than\nthe young king's son - he is with me in a moment.  Ah. You\nwicked child, cried the enchantress.  What do I hear you say.  I\nthought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have\ndeceived me.  In her anger she clutched rapunzel's beautiful\ntresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of\nscissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the\nlovely braids lay on the ground.  And she was so pitiless that she\ntook poor rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\ngrief and misery.\nOn the same day that she cast out rapunzel, however, the\nenchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to\nthe hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried,\n     rapunzel, rapunzel,\n     let down your hair,\nshe let the hair down.  The king's son ascended, but instead of\nfinding his dearest rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed\nat him with wicked and venomous looks.  Aha, she cried mockingly,\nyou would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits\nno longer singing in the nest.  The cat has got it, and will scratch\nout your eyes as well.  Rapunzel is lost to you.  You will never see\nher again.  The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in\nhis despair he leapt down from the tower.  He escaped with his life,\nbut the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.  Then he\nwandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and\nberries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his\ndearest wife.  Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\nlength came to the desert where rapunzel, with the twins to which\nshe had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.  He\nheard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards\nit, and when he approached, rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck\nand wept.  Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear\nagain, and he could see with them as before.  He led her to his\nkingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long\ntime afterwards, happy and contented.\n"
