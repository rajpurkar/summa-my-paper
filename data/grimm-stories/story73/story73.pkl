S"\tAllerleirauh\n\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a wife with golden hair,\nand she was so beautiful that her equal was not to be found on earth.\nIt came to pass that she lay ill, and as she felt that she must soon\ndie, she called the king and said, if you wish to marry again after\nmy death, take no one who is not quite as beautiful as I am, and who\nhas not just such golden hair as I have, this you must promise me.\nAnd after the king had promised her this she closed her eyes and\ndied.\n\nFor a long time the king could not be comforted, and had no thought\nof taking another wife.  At length his councillors said, this cannot\ngo on.  The king must marry again, that we may have a queen.  And now\nmessengers were sent about far and wide, to seek a bride who equalled\nthe late queen in beauty.  In the whole world, however, none was to\nbe found, and even if one had been found, still there would have been\nno one who had such golden hair.  So the messengers came home as they\nwent.\n\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead\nmother, and had the same golden hair.  When she was grown up the king\nlooked at her one day, and saw that in every respect she was like his\nlate wife, and suddenly felt a violent love for her.  Then he spoke\nto his councillors, I will marry my daughter, for she is the\ncounterpart of my late wife, otherwise I can find no bride who\nresembles her.  When the councillors heard that, they were shocked,\nand said, God has forbidden a father to marry his daughter.  No good\ncan come from such a crime, and the kingdom will be involved in the\nruin.\n\nThe daughter was still more shocked when she became aware of her\nfather's resolution, but hoped to turn him from his design. Then she\nsaid to him, before I fulfil your wish, I must have three dresses,\none as golden as the sun, one as silvery as the moon, and one as\nbright as the stars, besides this, I wish for a mantle of a thousand\ndifferent kinds of fur and peltry joined together, and one of every\nkind of animal in your kingdom must give a piece of his skin for it.\nFor she thought, to get that will be quite impossible, and thus I\nshall divert my father from his wicked intentions.  The king,\nhowever, did not give it up, and the cleverest maidens in his kingdom\nhad to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as\nsilvery as the moon, and one as bright as the stars, and his huntsmen\nhad to catch one of every kind of animal in the whole of his kingdom,\nand take from it a piece of its skin, and out of these was made a\nmantle of a thousand different kinds of fur.  At length, when all was\nready, the king caused the mantle to be brought, spread it out before\nher, and said, the wedding shall be tomorrow.\n\nWhen, therefore, the king's daughter saw that there was no longer any\nhope of turning her father's heart, she resolved to run away.  In the\nnight whilst every one was asleep, she got up, and took three\ndifferent things from her treasures, a golden ring, a golden\nspinning-wheel, and a golden reel.  The three dresses of the sun,\nmoon, and stars she placed into a nutshell, put on her mantle of all\nkinds of fur, and blackened her face and hands with soot.  Then she\ncommended herself to God, and went away, and walked the whole night\nuntil she reached a great forest.  And as she was tired, she got into\na hollow tree, and fell asleep.\n\nThe sun rose, and she slept on, and she was still sleeping when it\nwas full day.  Then it so happened that the king to whom this forest\nbelonged, was hunting in it.  When his dogs came to the tree, they\nsniffed, and ran barking round about it.  The king said to the\nhuntsmen, just see what kind of wild beast has hidden itself in\nthere.  The huntsmen obeyed his order, and when they came back they\nsaid, a wondrous beast is lying in the hollow tree, we have never\nbefore seen one like it.  Its skin is fur of a thousand different\nkinds, but it is lying asleep.  Said the king, see if you can catch\nit alive, and then fasten it to the carriage, and we will take it\nwith us.  When the huntsmen laid hold of the maiden, she awoke full\nof terror, and cried to them, I am a poor child, deserted by father\nand mother, have pity on me, and take me with you.  Then said they,\nAllerleirauh, you will be useful in the kitchen, come with us, and\nyou can sweep up the ashes.  So they put her in the carriage, and\ntook her home to the royal palace.  There they pointed out to her a\ncloset under the stairs, where no daylight entered, and said, hairy\nanimal, there you can live and sleep.  Then she was sent into the\nkitchen, and there she carried wood and water, swept the hearth,\nplucked the fowls, picked the vegetables, raked the ashes, and did\nall the dirty work.\n\nAllerleirauh lived there for a long time in great wretchedness. Alas,\nfair princess, what is to become of you now.  It happened, however,\nthat one day a feast was held in the palace, and she said to the\ncook, may I go upstairs for a while, and look on.  I will place\nmyself outside the door.  The cook answered, yes, go, but you must be\nback here in half-an-hour to sweep the hearth.\n\nThen she took her oil-lamp, went into her den, put off her dress of\nfur, and washed the soot off her face and hands, so that her full\nbeauty once more came to light.  And she opened the nut, and took out\nher dress which shone like the sun, and when she had done that she\nwent up to the festival, and every one made way for her, for no one\nknew her, and thought no otherwise than that she was a king's\ndaughter.  The king came to meet her, gave his hand to her, and\ndanced with her, and thought in his heart, my eyes have never yet\nseen any one so beautiful.  When the dance was over she curtsied, and\nwhen the king looked round again she had vanished, and none knew\nwhither.  The guards who stood outside the palace were called and\nquestioned, but no one had seen her.\n\nShe had run into her little den, however, there quickly taken off her\ndress, made her face and hands black again, put on the mantle of fur,\nand again was Allerleirauh.  And now when she went into the kitchen,\nand was about to get to her work and sweep up the ashes, the cook\nsaid, leave that alone till morning, and make me the soup for the\nking, I, too, will go upstairs awhile, and take a look, but let no\nhairs fall in, or in future you shall have nothing to eat.  So the\ncook went away, and Allerleirauh made the soup for the king, and made\nbread soup and the best she could, and when it was ready she fetched\nher golden ring from her little den, and put it in the bowl in which\nthe soup was served.  When the dancing was over, the king had his\nsoup brought and ate it, and he liked it so much that it seemed to\nhim he had never tasted better.  But when he came to the bottom of\nthe bowl, he saw a golden ring lying, and could not conceive how it\ncould have got there.  Then he ordered the cook to appear before him.\nThe cook was terrified when he heard the order, and said to\nAllerleirauh, you have certainly let a hair fall into the soup, and\nif you have, you shall be beaten for it.\n\nWhen he came before the king the latter asked who had made the soup.\nThe cook replied, I made it.  But the king said, that is not true,\nfor it was much better than usual, and cooked differently.  He\nanswered, I must acknowledge that I did not make it, it was made by\nthe hairy animal.  The king said, go and bid it come up here.\n\nWhen Allerleirauh came, the king said, who are you.  I am a poor girl\nwho no longer has any father or mother.  He asked further, of what\nuse are you in my palace.  She answered, I am good for nothing but to\nhave boots thrown at my head.  He continued, where did you get the\nring which was in the soup.  She answered, I know nothing about the\nring.  So the king could learn nothing, and had to send her away\nagain.\n\nAfter a while, there was another festival, and then, as before,\nAllerleirauh begged the cook for leave to go and look on.  He\nanswered, yes, but come back again in half-an-hour, and make the king\nthe bread soup which he so much likes.  Then she ran into her den,\nwashed herself quickly, and took out of the nut the dress which was\nas silvery as the moon, and put it on.  Then she went up and was like\na princess, and the king stepped forward to meet her, and rejoiced to\nsee her once more, and as the dance was just beginning they danced it\ntogether.  But when it was ended, she again disappeared so quickly\nthat the king could not observe where she went.  She, however, sprang\ninto her den, and once more made herself a hairy animal, and went\ninto the kitchen to prepare the bread soup.  When the cook had gone\nupstairs, she fetched the little golden spinning-wheel, and put it in\nthe bowl so that the soup covered it.  Then it was taken to the king,\nwho ate it, and liked it as much as before, and had the cook brought,\nwho this time likewise was forced to confess that Allerleirauh had\nprepared the soup.  Allerleirauh again came before the king, but she\nanswered that she was good for nothing else but to have boots thrown\nat her head, and that she knew nothing at all about the little golden\nspinning-wheel.\n\nWhen, for the third time, the king held a festival, all happened just\nas it had done before.  The cook said, fur-skin, you are a witch, and\nalways put something in the soup which makes it so good that the king\nlikes it better than that which I cook, but as she begged so hard, he\nlet her go up at the appointed time.  And now she put on the dress\nwhich shone like the stars, and thus entered the hall.  Again the\nking danced with the beautiful maiden, and thought that she never yet\nhad been so beautiful.\n\nAnd whilst she was dancing, he contrived, without her noticing it, to\nslip a golden ring on her finger, and he had given orders that the\ndance should last a very long time.  When it was ended, he wanted to\nhold her fast by her hands, but she tore herself loose, and sprang\naway so quickly through the crowd that she vanished from his sight.\nShe ran as fast as she could into her den beneath the stairs, but as\nshe had been too long, and had stayed more than half-an-hour she\ncould not take off her pretty dress, but only threw over it her\nmantle of fur, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black,\nbut one finger remained white.  Then Allerleirauh ran into the\nkitchen, and cooked the bread soup for the king, and as the cook was\naway, put her golden reel into it.\n\nWhen the king found the reel at the bottom of it, he caused\nAllerleirauh to be summoned, and then he espied the white finger, and\nsaw the ring which he had put on it during the dance.  Then he\ngrasped her by the hand, and held her fast, and when she wanted to\nrelease herself and run away, her mantle of fur opened a little, and\nthe star-dress shone forth.  The king clutched the mantle and tore it\noff.  Then her golden hair shone forth, and she stood there in full\nsplendor, and could no longer hide herself.  And when she had washed\nthe soot and ashes from her face, she was more beautiful than anyone\nwho had ever been seen on earth.  But the king said, you are my dear\nbride, and we will never more part from each other. Thereupon the\nmarriage was solemnized, and they lived happily until their death.\n"
