S"A young boy dies and his mother cries for her boy continually. The boy's ghost begins appearing at night. The ghost begs its mother to stop crying so its burial shroud will dry and it can rest comfortably in the grave. The mother gives her sorrow to God and the child is able to rest peacefully."

S'There was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old, who\nwas so handsome and lovable that no one could look at him without\nliking him, and she herself worshipped him above everything in the\nworld.  Now it so happened that he suddenly became ill, and God took\nhim to himself, and for this the mother could not be comforted and\nwept both day and night.  But soon afterwards, when the child had\nbeen buried, it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and\nplayed during its life, and if the mother wept, it wept also, and\nwhen morning came it disappeared.  But as the mother would not stop\ncrying, it came one night, in the little white shroud in which it had\nbeen laid in its coffin, and with its wreath of flowers round its\nhead, and stood on the bed at her feet, and said, "Oh, mother, do\nstop crying, or I shall never fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud\nwill not dry because of all your tears, which fall upon it." The\nmother was afraid when she heard that, and wept no more.  The next\nnight the child came again, and held a little light in its hand, and\nsaid, "Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my\ngrave." Then the mother gave her sorrow into God\'s keeping, and bore\nit quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in\nits little bed beneath the earth.\n'
