S"There was once a king who had a son who asked in marriage the\ndaughter of a mighty king, she was called maid maleen, and was\nvery beautiful.  As her father wished to give her to another,\nthe prince was rejected, but as they both loved each other with\nall their hearts, they would not give each other up, and\nmaid maleen said to her father, I can and will take no other for\nmy husband.  Then the king flew into a passion, and ordered a\ndark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight\nshould enter.  When it was finished, he said, therein shall you be\nimprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if your\nperverse spirit is broken.  Meat and drink for the seven years\nwere carried into the tower, and then she and her maid-in-waiting\nwere led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and\nfrom the earth.  There they sat in the darkness, and knew not\nwhen day or night began.  The king's son often went round and\nround the tower, and called their names, but no sound from\nwithout pierced through the thick walls.  What else could they do\nbut lament and complain.\nMeanwhile the time passed, and by the decline of food and drink\nthey knew that the seven years were coming to an end.  They\nthought the moment of their deliverance was come, but no stroke\nof the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it\nseemed to maid maleen that her father had forgotten her.  As\nthey had food only for a short time longer, and saw a miserable\ndeath awaiting them, maid maleen said, we must try our last\nchance, and see if we can break through the wall.  She took the\nbread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and\nwhen she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn.  With great\nlabor they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second,\nand a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light\nfell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that\nthey could look out.  The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze\nplayed on their faces, but how melancholy everything looked all\naround.  Her father's castle lay in ruins, the town and the\nvillages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the\nfields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible.\nWhen the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip\nthrough, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then maid maleen\nfollowed.  But where were they to go.  The enemy had ravaged the\nwhole kingdom, driven away the king, and slain all the inhabitants.\nThey wandered forth to seek another\ncountry, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to\ngive them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that\nthey were forced to appease their hunger with nettles.  When,\nafter long journeying, they came into another country, they tried\nto get work everywhere, but wherever they knocked they were turned\naway, and no one would have pity on them.  At last they arrived in\na large city and went to the royal palace.  There also they were\nordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay\nin the kitchen and be scullions.\nThe son of the king in whose kingdom they were, however, was the\nvery man who had been betrothed to maid maleen.  His father had\nchosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart\nwas wicked.  The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already\narrived, but because of her great ugliness she shut herself in\nher room, and allowed no one to see her, and maid maleen had to\ntake her her meals from the kitchen.  When the day came for the\nbride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her\nugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets,\nshe would be mocked and laughed at by the people.  Then said she\nto maid maleen, a great piece of luck has befallen you.  I have\nsprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets, you\nshall put on wedding-clothes and take my place, a greater honor\nthan that you cannot have.  Maid maleen, however, refused it, and\nsaid, I wish for no honor which is not suitable for me.  It was in\nvain, too, that the bride offered her gold.  At last she said\nangrily, if you do not obey me, it shall cost you your life.  I\nhave but to speak the word, and your head will lie at your feet.\nThen she was forced to obey, and put on the bride's magnificent\nclothes and all her jewels.  When she entered the royal hall, every\none was amazed at her great beauty, and the king said to his son,\nthis is the bride whom I have chosen for you, and whom you must\nlead to church.  The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, she\nis like my maid maleen, and I should believe that it was she\nherself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.\nHe took her by the hand and led her to church.  On the way was a\nnettle-plant, and she said,\n     oh, nettle-plant,\n     little nettle-plant,\n     what dost thou here alone.\n     I have known the time\n     when I ate thee unboiled\n     when I ate thee unroasted.\nWhat are you saying, asked the king's son.  Nothing, she replied,\nI was only thinking of maid maleen.  He was surprised that she knew\nabout her, but kept silence.  When they came to the foot-plank\ninto the chuchyard, she said,\n     foot-bridge, do not break,\n     I am not the true bride.\nWhat are you saying there, asked the the king's son.  Nothing, she\nreplied, I was only thinking of maid maleen.  Do you know maid\nmaleen.  No, she answered, how should I know her, I have only\nheard of her.  When they came to the church-door, she said once\nmore,\n     church-door, break not,\n     I am not the true bride.\nWhat are you saying there asked he.  Ah, she answered, I was only\nthinking of maid maleen.  Then he took out a precious chain, put it\nround her neck, and fastened the clasp.  Thereupon they entered the\nchurch, and the priest joined their hands together before the\naltar, and married them.  He led her home, but she did not speak\na single word the whole way.  When they got back to the royal\npalace, she hurried into the bride's chamber, put off the\nmagnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray\ngown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had\nreceived from the bridegroom.\nWhen the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince's\napartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not\nobserve the deception.  As soon as everyone had gone away, he said\nto her,  what did you say to the nettle-plant which was growing\nby the wayside.\nTo which nettle-plant, asked she, I don't talk to nettle-plants.\nIf you did not do it, then you are not the true bride, said he.\nSo she bethought herself, and said,\n     I must go out unto my maid\n     who keeps my thoughts for me.\nShe went out and sought maid maleen.  Girl, what have you been\nsaying to the nettle.  I said nothing but,\n     oh, nettle-plant,\n     little nettle-plant,\n     what dost thou here alone.\n     I have known the time\n     when I ate thee unboiled,\n     when I ate thee unroasted.\nThe bride ran back into the chamber, and said, I know now\nwhat I said to the nettle, and she repeated the words which she had\njust heard.  But what did you say to the foot-bridge when we went\nover it asked the king's son.  To the foot-bridge, she answered.\nI don't talk to foot-bridges.  Then you are not the true bride.\nShe again said,\n     I must go out unto my maid,\n     who keeps my thoughts for me.\nAnd ran out and scolded maid maleen, girl, what did you say to the\nfoot-bridge.\nI said nothing but,\n     foot-bridge, do not break,\n     I am not the true bride.\nThat costs you your life, cried the bride, but she hurried into\nthe room and said, I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,\nand she repeated the words.  But what did you say to the\nchurch-door.  To the church-door, she replied, I don't talk to\nchurch-doors.  Then you are not the true bride.\nShe went out and scolded maid maleen, and said, girl, what did you\nsay to the church-door.  I said nothing but,\n     church-door, break not,\n     I am not the true bride.\nThat will break your neck for you, cried the bride, and flew\ninto a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and\nsaid, I know now what I said to the church-door, and she\nrepeated the words.  But where have you the jewel which I gave you\nat the church-door.  What jewel, she answered, you did not give\nme any jewel.  I myself put it round your neck, and I myself\nfastened it, if you do not know that, you are not the true bride.\nHe drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable\nugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, how do you come here.\nWho are you.  I am your betrothed bride, but because I feared lest\nthe people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I\ncommanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to\ngo to church instead of me.  Where is the girl, said he\nI want to see her, go and bring her here.  She went out\nand told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and\nthat they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her\nhead.  The servants laid hold of maid maleen and wanted to drag her\nout, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the king's son\nheard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to\nset the maiden free instantly.  Lights were brought, and then he\nsaw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the\nchurch-door.  You are the true bride, said he, who went with me\nto church, come with me now to my room.  When they were both alone,\nhe said, on the way to the church you did name maid maleen, who\nwas my betrothed bride.  If I could believe it possible, I should\nthink she was standing before me - you are like her in every\nrespect.  She answered, I am maid maleen, who for your sake was\nimprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and\nthirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty.  Today,\nhowever, the sun is shining on me once more.  I was married to\nyou in the church, and I am your lawful wife.  Then they kissed\neach other, and were happy all the days of their lives.  The\nfalse bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her\nhead cut off.\nThe tower in which maid maleen had been imprisoned remained\nstanding for a long time, and when the children passed by it\nthey sang,\n     king, klang, gloria.\n     Who sits within this tower.\n     A king's daughter, she sits within,\n     a sight of her I cannot win,\n     the wall it will not break,\n     the stone cannot be pierced.\n     Little Hans, with your coat so gay,\n     follow me, follow me, fast as you may.\n"
