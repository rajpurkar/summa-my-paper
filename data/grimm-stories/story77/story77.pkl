S'There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early\nmorning till late at night.  When at last he had laid by some\nmoney he said to his boy, "You are my only child, I will spend the\nmoney which I have earned with the sweat of my brow on your\neducation, if you learn some honest trade you can support me in\nmy old age, when my limbs have grown stiff and I am obliged to\nstay at home."\n\nThen the boy went to a high school and learned\ndiligently so that his masters praised him, and he remained\nthere a long time.  When he had worked through two classes, but\nwas still not yet perfect in everything, the little pittance\nwhich the father had earned was all spent, and the boy was\nobliged to return home to him.\n\n"Ah," said the father, sorrowfully, "I can\ngive you no more, and in these hard times I cannot earn a\nfarthing more than will suffice for our daily bread."  "Dear\nfather," answered the son, "don\'t trouble yourself about it, if it\nis God\'s will, it will turn to my advantage.  I shall soon\naccustom myself to it."  When the father wanted to go into the\nforest to earn money by helping to chop and stack wood, the\nson said, "I will go with you and help you."  "Nay, my son," said\nthe father, "that would be hard for you.  You are not accustomed\nto rough work, and will not be able to bear it.  Besides, I have\nonly one axe and no money left wherewith to buy another."  "Just\ngo to the neighbor," answered the son, "he will lend you his axe\nuntil I have earned one for myself."\n\nThe father then borrowed an axe of the neighbor, and next\nmorning at break of day they went out into the forest together.\nThe son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about\nit.  But when the sun was right over their heads, the father\nsaid, "We will rest, and have our dinner, and then we shall work\ntwice as well."  The son took his bread in his hands, and said,\n"Just you rest, father, I am not tired, I will walk up and down\na little in the forest, and look for birds\' nests."  "Oh, you fool,"\nsaid the father, "why should you want to run about there?  Afterwards\nyou will be tired, and no longer able to raise your arm.\nStay here, and sit down beside me."\n\nThe son, however, went into the forest, ate his bread, was very\nmerry and peered in among the green branches to see if he could\ndiscover a bird\'s nest anywhere.  So he walked to and fro until\nat last he came to a great dangerous-looking oak, which\ncertainly was already many hundred years old, and which five\nmen could not have spanned.  He stood still and looked at it, and\nthought, many a bird must have built its nest in that.  Then all at\nonce it seemed to him that he heard a voice.  He listened and\nbecame aware that someone was crying in a very smothered voice,\n"Let me out, let me out."  He looked around, but could discover\nnothing.  Then he fancied that the voice came out of the ground.\nSo he cried, "Where are you?"  The voice answered, "I am down here\namongst the roots of the oak-tree.  Let me out.  Let me out."\n\nThe schoolboy began to loosen the earth under the tree, and search\namong the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little\nhollow.  He lifted it up and held it against the light, and then\nsaw a creature shaped like a frog, springing up and down in it.\n"Let me out.  Let me out," it cried anew, and the boy thinking no\nevil, drew the cork out of the bottle.  Immediately a spirit\nascended from it, and began to grow, and grew so fast that in a\nvery few moments he stood before the boy, a terrible fellow as big\nas half the tree.  "Do you know," he cried in an awful voice, "what\nyour reward is for having let me out?"  "No," replied the boy\nfearlessly, "how should I know that?"  "Then I will tell you," cried\nthe spirit, "I must strangle you for it."  "You should have told me\nthat sooner," said the boy, "for I should then have left you shut\nup, but my head shall stand fast for all you can do, more persons\nthan one must be consulted about that."  "More persons here, more\npersons there," said the spirit.  "You shall have the reward you\nhave earned.  Do you think that I was shut up there for such a\nlong time as a favor.  No, it was a punishment for me.  I am the\nmighty Mercurius.  Whoso releases me, him must I strangle."\n"Slowly," answered the boy, "not so fast.  I must first know that\nyou really were shut up in that little bottle, and that you are\nthe right spirit.  If, indeed, you can get in again, I will believe\nand then you may do as you will with me."  The spirit said\nhaughtily, "that is a very trifling feat."  Drew himself together,\nand made himself as small and slender as he had been at first, so\nthat he crept through the same opening, and right through the neck\nof the bottle in again.  Scarcely was he within than the boy\nthrust the cork he had drawn back into the bottle, and threw\nit among the roots of the oak into its old place, and the spirit\nwas deceived.\n\nAnd now the schoolboy was about to return to his father, but the\nspirit cried very piteously, "Ah, do let me out, ah, do let me out."\n"No," answered the boy, "not a second time.  He who has once tried to\ntake my life shall not be set free by me, now that I have caught\nhim again."  "If you will set me free," said the spirit, "I will give\nyou so much that you will have plenty all the days of your life."\n"No," answered the boy, "you would cheat me as you did the first time."\n"You are spurning you own good luck," said the spirit, "I will do you\nno harm but will reward you richly."  The boy thought, "I will\nventure it, perhaps he will keep his word, and anyhow he shall not\nget the better of me."\n\nThen he took out the cork, and the spirit\nrose up from the bottle as he had done before, stretched himself\nout and became as big as a giant.  "Now you shall have your reward,"\nsaid he, and handed the boy a little rag just like stiking-plaster,\nand said, "If you spread one end of this over a wound it\nwill heal, and if you rub steel or iron with the other end it will\nbe changed into silver."  "I must just try that," said the boy, and\nwent to a tree, tore off the bark with his axe, and rubbed it\nwith one end of the plaster.  It immediately closed together and\nwas healed.  "Now, it is all right," he said to the spirit, "and we\ncan part."  The spirit thanked him for his release, and the boy\nthanked the spirit for his present, and went back to his father.\n\n"Where have you been racing about?" said the father.  "Why have you\nforgotten your work?  I always said that you would never come to\nanything."  "Be easy, father, I will make it up."  "Make it up indeed,"\nsaid the father angrily, "that\'s no use."  "Take care, father, I will\nsoon hew that tree there, so that it will split."  Then he took\nhis plaster, rubbed the axe with it, and dealt a mighty blow, but\nas the iron had changed into silver, the edge bent.  "Hi, father,\njust look what a bad axe you\'ve given me, it has become quite\ncrooked."  The father was shocked and said, "Ah, what have you done!\nNow I shall have to pay for that, and have not the wherewithal, and\nthat is all the good I have got by your\nwork."  "Don\'t get angry," said the son, "I will soon pay for the axe."\n"Oh, you blockhead," cried the father, "Wherewith will you pay for it?\nYou have nothing but what I give you.  These are students\' tricks\nthat are sticking in your head, you have no idea of woodcutting."\n\nAfter a while the boy said, "Father, I can really work no more, we\nhad better take a holiday."  "Eh, what," answered he, "do you think I\nwill sit with my hands lying in my lap like you.  I must go on\nworking, but you may take yourself off home."  "Father, I am here in\nthis wood for the first time, I don\'t know my way alone.  Do go\nwith me."  As his anger had now abated, the father at last let\nhimself be persuaded and went home with him. Then he said to the\nson, "Go and sell your damaged axe, and see what you can get for it,\nand I must earn the difference, in order to pay the neighbor."\n\nThe son took the axe, and carried it into town to a goldsmith,\nwho tested it, laid it in the scales, and said, "It is worth four\nhundred talers, I have not so much as that by me."  The son said,\n"Give me what thou have, I will lend you the rest."  The goldsmith\ngave him three hundred talers, and remained a hundred in his\ndebt.  The son thereupon went home and said, "Father, I have got\nthe money, go and ask the neighbor what he wants for the axe."\n"I know that already," answered the old man, "one taler, six groschen."\n"Then give him him two talers, twelve groschen, that is double and\nenough.  See, I have money in plenty."  And he gave the father\na hundred talers, and said, "You shall never know want, live as\ncomfortably as you like."\n\n"Good heavens," said the father, "how\nhave you come by these riches?"  The boy then told how all had come\nto pass, and how he, trusting in his luck, had made such a packet.\nBut with the money that was left, he went back to the high school\nand went on learning more, and as he could heal all wounds with\nhis plaster, he became the most famous doctor in the whole world.\n'
