S"There was once a wizard who used to take the form of a poor\nman, and went to houses and begged, and caught pretty girls.\nNo one knew whither he carried them, for they were never\nseen again.  One day he appeared before the door of a man\nwho had three pretty daughters.  He looked like a poor weak\nbeggar, and carried a basket on his back, as if he meant to collect\ncharitable gifts in it.  He begged for a little food, and when\nthe eldest daughter came out and was just handing him a\npiece of bread, he did but touch her, and she was forced to jump\ninto his basket.  Thereupon he hurried off with long strides, and\ncarried her away into a dark forest to his house, which stood\nin the midst of it.  Everything in the house was magnificent.\nHe gave her whatsoever she could possibly desire, and said,\nmy darling, you will certainly be happy with me, for you have\neverything your heart can wish for.  This lasted a few days, and\nthen he said, I must journey forth, and\nleave you alone for a short time.  Here are the keys of the house.\nYou may go everywhere and look at everything except into one\nroom, which this little key opens, and there I forbid you to go\non pain of death.  He likewise gave her an egg and said, preserve\nthe egg carefully for me, and carry it continually about with you,\nfor a great misfortune would arise from the loss of it.\n\nShe took the keys and the egg, and promised to obey him in\neverything.  When he was gone, she went all round the house from the\nbottom to the top, and examined everything.  The rooms shone with\nsilver and gold, and she thought she had never seen such great\nsplendor.  At length she came to the forbidden door.  She wished to\npass it by, but curiosity let her have no rest.  She examined the\nkey, it looked just like any other.  She put it in the keyhole and\nturned it a little, and the door sprang open.  But what did she\nsee when she went in.  A great bloody basin stood in the middle\nof the room, and therein lay human beings, dead and hewn to pieces,\nand hard by was a block of wood, and a gleaming axe lay upon it.\nShe was so terribly alarmed that the egg which she held in her\nhand fell into the basin.  She got it out and wiped the blood off,\nbut in vain, it appeared again in a moment.  She washed and\nscrubbed, but she could not get it off.\n\nIt was not long before the man came back from his journey, and\nthe first things which he asked for were the key and the egg.\nShe gave them to him, but she trembled as she did so, and he saw\nat once by the red spots that she had been in the bloody chamber.\nSince you have gone into the room against my will, said he, you\nshall go back into it against your own.  Your life is ended.\nHe threw her down, dragged her along by her hair, cut her head off\non the block, and hewed her in pieces so that her blood ran on\nthe ground.  Then he threw her into the basin with the rest.\n\nNow I will fetch myself the second, said the wizard, and again he\nwent to the house in the shape of a poor man, and begged.  Then\nthe second daughter brought him a piece of bread.  He caught her\nlike the first, by simply touching her, and carried her away.\nShe did not fare better than her sister.  She allowed herself to be\nled\naway by her curiosity, opened the door of the bloody chamber,\nlooked in, and had to atone for it with her life on the wizard's\nreturn.  Then he went and brought the third sister, but she\nwas clever and wily.  When he had given her the keys and the egg,\nand had left her, she first put the egg away with great care, and\nthen she examined the house, and at last went into the forbidden\nroom.  Alas, what did she behold.  Both her dear sisters lay there\nin the basin, cruelly murdered, and cut into pieces.  But she\nbegan to gather their limbs together and put them in order, head,\nbody, arms and legs.  And when nothing further was wanting the\nlimbs began to move and unite themselves together, and both the\nmaidens opened their eyes and were once more alive.  Then they\nrejoiced and kissed and caressed each other.\n\nOn his arrival, the man at once demanded the keys and the egg,\nand as he could perceive no trace of any blood on it, he said,\nyou have stood the test, you shall be my bride.  He now had\nno longer any power over her, and was forced to do whatsoever\nshe desired.  Oh, very well, said she, you shall first take a\nbasketful of gold to my father and mother, and carry it\nyourself on your back.  In the meantime I will prepare for the\nwedding.  Then she ran to her sisters, whom she had hidden\nin a little chamber, and said, the moment has come when I can\nsave you.  The wretch shall himself carry you home again, but\nas soon as you are at home send help to me.  She put both of\nthem in a basket and covered them quite over with gold, so\nthat nothing of them was to be seen.  Then she called in the\nwizard and said to him, now carry the basket away, but I\nshall look through my little window and watch to see if you\nstop on the way to stand or to rest.\n\nThe wizard raised the basket on his back and went away with\nit, but it weighed him down so heavily that the sweat streamed\nfrom his face.  Then he sat down and wanted to rest awhile, but\nimmediately one of the girls in the basket cried, I am looking\nthrough my little window, and I see that you are resting.\nWill you go on at once.  He thought it was his bride who was\ntalking to\nhim, and he got up on his legs again.  Once more he was going to\nsit down, but instantly she cried, I am looking through my\nlittle window, and I see that you are resting.  Will you go on\ndirectly.  And whenever he stood still, she cried this, and then\nhe was forced to go onwards, until at last, groaning and out\nof breath, he took the basket with the gold and the two\nmaidens into their parents, house.  At home, however, the\nbride prepared the marriage-feast, and sent invitations to the\nfriends of the wizard.  Then she took a skull with grinning\nteeth, put some ornaments on it and a wreath of flowers,\ncarried it upstairs to the garret-window, and let it look out\nfrom thence.  When all was ready, she got into a barrel of\nhoney, and then cut the feather-bed open and rolled herself\nin it, until she looked like a wondrous bird, and no one could\nrecognize her.  Then she went out of the house, and on her\nway she met some of the wedding-guests, who asked,\n          o, fitcher's bird, how com'st thou here.\n          I come from fitcher's house quite near.\n          And what may the young bride be doing.\n          From cellar to garret she's swept all clean,\n          and now from the window she's peeping, I ween.\n\nAt last she met the bridegroom, who was coming slowly back.\nHe, like the others, asked,\n          o, fitcher's bird, how com'st thou here.\n          I come from fitcher's house quite near.\n          And what may the young bride be doing.\n          From cellar to garret she's swept all clean,\n          and now from the window she's peeping, I ween.\n\nThe bridegroom looked up, saw the decked-out skull, thought it\nwas his bride, and nodded to her, greeting her kindly.  But\nwhen he and his guests had all gone into the house, the\nbrothers and kinsmen of the bride, who had been sent to rescue\nher, arrived.  They locked all the doors of the house, that no\none might escape, set fire to it, and the wizard and all his\ncrew had to burn.\n"
