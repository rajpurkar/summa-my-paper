S'A group of villagers visit a town with a fake moon hung in an oak tree. These villagers had never seen a moon before and decided they could use the moon to light their village at night. The villagers steal the moon and hang it in their own village. As the four men grow old and die, they each request their quarter of the moon be buried with them. When the last one dies, the village is dark again at night. The quarters of the moon reunite, however, and the dead wake and begin to roam the earth. St. Peter goes down to earth from heaven, forces the dead to lie back in their graves, then takes the moon and hang it in the heavens. '

S"In days gone by there was a land where the nights were always dark,\nand the sky spread over it like a black cloth, for there the moon\nnever rose, and no star shone in the gloom.  At the creation of\nthe world, the light at night had been sufficient.  Three young\nfellows once went out of this country on a traveling expedition,\nand arrived in another kingdom, where, in the evening when the sun\nhad disappeared behind the mountains, a shining globe was placed\non an oak-tree, which shed a soft light far and wide.  By means\nof this, everything could very well be seen and distinguished,\neven though it was not so brilliant as the sun.  The travelers\nstopped and\nasked a countryman who was driving past with his cart, what kind\nof a light that was.  That is the moon, answered he, our mayor\nbought it for three talers, and fastened it to the oak-tree.  He\nhas to pour oil into it daily, and to keep it clean, so that it\nmay always burn clearly.  He receives a taler a week from us\nfor doing it.\nWhen the countryman had driven away, one of them said, we could\nmake some use of this lamp, we have an oak-tree at home, which is\njust as big as this, and we could hang it on that.  What a\npleasure it would be not to have to feel about at night in the\ndarkness.  I'll tell you what we'll do, said the second, we will\nfetch a cart and horses and carry away the moon.  The people here\nmay buy themselves another.  I'm a good climber, said the third, I\nwill bring it down.  The fourth brought a cart and horses, and the\nthird climbed the tree, bored a hole in the moon, passed a rope\nthrough it, and let it down.  When the shining ball lay in the\ncart, they covered it over with a cloth, that no one might observe\nthe theft.  They conveyed it safely into their own country, and\nplaced it on a high oak.  Old and young rejoiced, when the new\nlamp let its light shine over the whole land, and bed-rooms and\nsitting-rooms were filled with it.  The dwarfs came forth from\ntheir caves in the rocks, and the tiny elves in their little red\ncoats danced in rings on the meadows.\nThe four took care that the moon was provided with oil, cleaned\nthe wick, and received their weekly taler, but they became old\nmen, and when one of them grew ill, and saw that he was about to\ndie, he appointed that one quarter of the moon, should, as his\nproperty, be laid in the grave with him.  When he died, the mayor\nclimbed up the tree, and cut off a quarter with the hedge-shears,\nand this was placed in his coffin.  The light of the moon\ndecreased, but still not visibly.  When the second died, the\nsecond quarter was buried with him, and the light diminished.  It\ngrew weaker still after the death of the third, who likewise took\nhis part of it away with him, and when the fourth was borne to his\ngrave, the old state of darkness recommenced, and whenever the\npeople went out at night without their lanterns they knocked\ntheir heads together in collision.\nWhen, however, the pieces of the moon had united themselves\ntogether again in the world below, where darkness had always\nprevailed, it came to pass that the dead became restless and awoke\nfrom their sleep.  They were astonished when they were able to\nsee again, the moonlight was quite sufficient for them, for their\neyes had become so weak that they could not have borne the\nbrilliance of the sun.  They rose up and were merry, and fell\ninto their former ways of living.  Some of them went to the play\nand to dance, others hastened to the public-houses, where they\nasked for wine, got drunk, brawled, quarreled, and at last took\nup cudgels, and belabored each other.  The noise became greater and\ngreater, and at last reached even to heaven.\nSt. Peter, who guards the gate of heaven, thought the lower world\nhad broken out in revolt and gathered together the heavenly hosts,\nwhich were employed to drive back the evil one when he and his\nassociates storm the abode of the blessed.  As these, however,\ndid not come, he got on his horse and rode through the gate of\nheaven, down into the world below.  There he reduced the dead to\nsubjection, bade them lie down in their graves again, took the\nmoon away with him, and hung it up in heaven.\n"
