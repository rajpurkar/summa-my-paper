A group of villagers visit a town with a fake moon hung in an oak tree. These villagers had never seen a moon before and decided they could use the moon to light their village at night. The villagers steal the moon and hang it in their own village. As the four men grow old and die, they each request their quarter of the moon be buried with them. When the last one dies, the village is dark again at night. The quarters of the moon reunite, however, and the dead wake and begin to roam the earth. St. Peter goes down to earth from heaven, forces the dead to lie back in their graves, then takes the moon and hang it in the heavens.
