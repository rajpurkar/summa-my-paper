A tailor finds a Jew on the road. He believes the Jew will have money with him so the tailor beats the Jew and demands money. The Jew says he has only eight farthings. As the Jew dies, his last words are: "The bright sun will bring it to light". The tailor assumes this saying refers to the Jew's money. Years later the man is drinking coffee at his home. The bright sunlight throws reflections off the ceiling and the man repeats the saying. The wife asks what it means. He tells her about the murder and begs her not to tell anyone. She spreads the story about town. Her husband is put on trial for murder and sentenced to death.
