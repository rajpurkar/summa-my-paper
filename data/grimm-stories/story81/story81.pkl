S"In olden times there was a king, who had behind his palace a\nbeautiful pleasure-garden in which there was a tree that bore golden\napples.  When the apples were getting ripe they were counted, but on\nthe very next morning one was missing.  This was told to the king,\nand he ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the\ntree.\n\nThe king had three sons, the eldest of whom he sent, as soon as night\ncame on, into the garden, but when midnight came he could not keep\nhimself from sleeping, and next morning again an apple was gone.\n\nThe following night the second son had to keep watch, but it fared no\nbetter with him, as soon as twelve o'clock had struck he fell asleep,\nand in the morning an apple was gone.\n\nNow it came to the turn of the third son to watch, and he was quite\nready, but the king had not much trust in him, and thought that he\nwould be of less use even than his brothers, but at last he let him\ngo.  The youth lay down beneath the tree, but kept awake, and did not\nlet sleep master him.  When it struck twelve, something rustled\nthrough the air, and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose\nfeathers were all shining with gold.\n\nThe bird alighted on the tree, and had just plucked off an apple,\nwhen the youth shot an arrow at him.  The bird flew off, but the\narrow had struck his plumage, and one of his golden feathers fell\ndown.  The youth picked it up, and the next morning took it to the\nking and told him what he had seen in the night.  The king called his\ncouncil together, and everyone declared that a feather like this was\nworth more than the whole kingdom.  If the feather is so precious,\ndeclared the king, one alone will not do for me, I must and will have\nthe whole bird.\n\nThe eldest son set out, and trusting to his cleverness thought that\nhe would easily find the golden bird.  When he had gone some distance\nhe saw a fox sitting at the edge of a wood so he cocked his gun and\ntook aim at him.  The fox cried, do not shoot me, and in return I\nwill give you some good counsel.  You are on the way to the golden\nbird, and this evening you will come to a village in which stand two\ninns opposite to one another.\n\nOne of them is lighted up brightly, and all goes on merrily within,\nbut do not go into it, go rather into the other, even though it looks\nlike a bad one.  How can such a silly beast give wise advice, thought\nthe king's son, and he pulled the trigger. But he missed the fox, who\nstretched out his tail and ran quickly into the wood.\n\nSo he pursued his way, and by evening came to the village where the\ntwo inns were, in one they were singing and dancing, the other had a\npoor, miserable look.  I should be a fool, indeed, he thought, if I\nwere to go into the shabby tavern, and pass by the good one.  So he\nwent into the cheerful one, lived there in riot and revel, and forgot\nthe bird and his father, and all good counsels.\n\nWhen many months had passed, and the eldest son did not come back\nhome, the second set out, wishing to find the golden bird.  The fox\nmet him as he had met the eldest, and gave him the good advice of\nwhich he took no heed.  He came to the two inns, and his brother was\nstanding at the window of the one from which came the music, and\ncalled out to him.  He could not resist, but went inside and lived\nonly for pleasure.\n\nAgain some time passed, and then the king's youngest son wanted to\nset off and try his luck, but his father would not allow it. It is of\nno use, said he, he will find the golden bird still less than his\nbrothers, and if a mishap were to befall him he knows not how to help\nhimself, he's not too bright at the best.  But at last, as he had no\npeace, he let him go.\n\nAgain the fox was sitting outside the wood, and begged for his life,\nand offered his good advice.  The youth was good-natured, and said,\nbe easy, little fox, I will do you no harm.  You shall not repent it,\nanswered the fox, and that you may get on more quickly, get up behind\non my tail.  And scarcely had he seated himself when the fox began to\nrun, and away he went over stock and stone till his hair whistled in\nthe wind.  When they came to the village the youth got off, he\nfollowed the good advice, and without looking round turned into the\nlittle inn, where he spent the night quietly.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as he got into the open country, there sat\nthe fox already, and said, I will tell you further what you have to\ndo.  Go on quite straight, and at last you will come to a castle, in\nfront of which a whole regiment of soldiers is lying, but do not\ntrouble yourself about them, for they will all be asleep and snoring.\nGo through the midst of them staight into the castle, and go through\nall the rooms, till at last you will come to a chamber where a golden\nbird is hanging in a wooden cage.  Close by, there stands an empty\ngold cage for show, but beware of taking the bird out of the common\ncage and putting it into the fine one, or it may go badly with you.\n\nWith these words the fox again stretched out his tail, and the king's\nson seated himself upon it, and away he went over stock and stone\ntill his hair whistled in the wind.\n\nWhen he came to the castle he found everything as the fox had said.\nThe king's son went into the chamber where the golden bird was shut\nup in a wooden cage, whilst a golden one stood by, and the three\ngolden apples lay about the room.  But, thought he, it would be\nabsurd if I were to leave the beautiful bird in the common and ugly\ncage, so he opened the door, laid hold of it, and put it into the\ngolden cage.  But at the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry.\nThe soldiers awoke, rushed in, and took him off to prison.  The next\nmorning he was taken before a court of justice, and as he confessed\neverything, was sentenced to death.\n\nThe king, however, said that he would grant him his life on one\ncondition - namely, if he brought him the golden horse which ran\nfaster than the wind, and in that case he should receive, over and\nabove, as a reward, the golden bird.\n\nThe king's son set off, but he sighed and was sorrowful, for how was\nhe to find the golden horse.  But all at once he saw his old friend\nthe fox sitting on the road.  Look you, said the fox, this has\nhappened because you did not give heed to me.  However, be of good\ncourage.  I will give you my help, and tell you how to get to the\ngolden horse.  You must go straight on, and you will come to a\ncastle, where in the stable stands the horse.  The grooms will be\nlying in front of the stable, but they will be asleep and snoring,\nand you can quietly lead out the golden horse. But of one thing you\nmust take heed, put on him the common saddle of wood and leather, and\nnot the golden one, which hangs close by, else it will go ill with\nyou.  Then the fox stretched out his tail, the king's son seated\nhimself upon it, and away he went over stock and stone until his hair\nwhistled in the wind.\n\nEverything happened just as the fox had said, the prince came to the\nstable in which the golden horse was standing, but just as he was\ngoing to put the common saddle upon him, he thought, such a beautiful\nbeast will be shamed if I do not give him the good saddle which\nbelongs to him by right.  But scarcely had the golden saddle touched\nthe horse than he began to neigh loudly. The grooms awoke, seized the\nyouth, and threw him into prison.\n\nThe next morning he was sentenced by the court to death, but the king\npromised to grant him his life, and the golden horse as well, if he\ncould bring back the beautiful princess from the golden castle.\n\nWith a heavy heart the youth set out, yet luckily for him he soon\nfound the trusty fox.  I ought only to leave you to your ill-luck,\nsaid the fox, but I pity you, and will help you once more out of your\ntrouble.  This road takes you straight to the golden castle, you will\nreach it by eventide, and at night when everything is quiet the\nbeautiful princess goes to the bathing-house to bathe. When she\nenters it, run up to her and give her a kiss, then she will follow\nyou, and you can take her away with you, only do not allow her to\ntake leave of her parents first, or it will go ill with you.\n\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, the king's son seated himself\nupon it, and away went the fox, over stock and stone, till his hair\nwhistled in the wind.\n\nWhen he reached the golden castle it was just as the fox had said. He\nwaited until midnight, when everything lay in deep sleep, and the\nbeautiful princess was going to the bathing-house. Then he sprang out\nand gave her a kiss.  She said that she would like to go with him,\nbut she asked him pitifully, and with tears, to allow her first to\ntake leave of her parents.  At first he withstood her prayer, but\nwhen she wept more and more, and fell at his feet, he at last gave\nin.  But no sooner had the maiden reached the bedside of her father\nthan he and all the rest in the castle awoke, and the youth was laid\nhold of and put into prison.\n\nThe next morning the king said to him, your life is forfeited, and\nyou can only find mercy if you take away the hill which stands in\nfront of my windows, and prevents my seeing beyond it, and you must\nfinish it all within eight days.  If you do that you shall have my\ndaughter as your reward.\n\nThe king's son began, and dug and shoveled without stopping, but when\nafter seven days he saw how little he had done, and how all his work\nwas as good as nothing, he fell into great sorrow and gave up all\nhope.  But on the evening of the seventh day the fox appeared and\nsaid, you do not deserve that I should take my trouble about you, but\njust go away and lie down to sleep, and I will do the work for you.\n\nThe next morning when he awoke and looked out of the window the hill\nhad gone.  The youth ran, full of joy, to the king, and told him that\nthe task was fulfilled, and whether he liked it or not, the king had\nto hold to his word and give him his daughter.\n\nSo the two set forth together, and it was not long before the trusty\nfox came up with them.  You have certainly got what is best, said he,\nbut the golden horse also belongs to the maiden of the golden castle.\nHow shall I get it, asked the youth. That I will tell you, answered\nthe fox, first take the beautiful maiden to the king who sent you to\nthe golden castle.  There will be unheard-of rejoicing, they will\ngladly give you the golden horse, and will bring it out to you.\nMount it as soon as possible, and offer your hand to all in farewell,\nlast of all to the beautiful maiden.  And as soon as you have taken\nher hand swing her up on to the horse, and gallop away, and no one\nwill be able to bring you back, for the horse runs faster than the\nwind.\n\nAll was carried out successfully, and the king's son carried off the\nbeautiful princess on the golden horse.\n\nThe fox did not remain behind, and he said to the youth, now I will\nhelp you to get the golden bird.  When you come near to the castle\nwhere the golden bird is to be found, let the maiden get down, and I\nwill take her into my care.  Then ride with the golden horse into the\ncastle-yard, there will be great rejoicing at the sight, and they\nwill bring out the golden bird for you.  As soon as you have the cage\nin your hand gallop back to us, and take the maiden away again.\n\nWhen the plan had succeeded, and the king's son was about to ride\nhome with his treasures, the fox said, now you shall reward me for my\nhelp.  What do you require for it, asked the youth.  When you get\ninto the wood yonder, shoot me dead, and chop off my head and feet.\n\nThat would be fine gratitude, said the king's son.  I cannot possibly\ndo that for you.\n\nThe fox said, if you will not do it I must leave you, but before I go\naway I will give you a piece of good advice.  Be careful about two\nthings.  Buy no gallows'-flesh, and do not sit at the edge of any\nwell.  And then he ran into the wood.\n\nThe youth thought, that is a wonderful beast, he has strange whims,\nwho on earth would want to buy gallows'-flesh.  As for the desire to\nsit at the edge of a well it has never yet occurred to me.\n\nHe rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his road took him again\nthrough the village in which his two brothers had remained. There was\na great stir and noise, and, when he asked what was going on, he was\ntold that two men were going to be hanged.  As he came nearer to the\nplace he saw that they were his brothers, who had been playing all\nkinds of wicked pranks, and had squandered all their wealth.  He\ninquired whether they could not be set free.  If you will pay for\nthem, answered the people, but why should you waste your money on\nwicked men, and buy them free. He did not think twice about it, but\npaid for them, and when they were set free they all went on their way\ntogether.\n\nThey came to the wood where the fox had first met them, and as it was\na hot day, but cool and pleasant within the wood, the two brothers\nsaid, let us rest a little by the well, and eat and drink.  He\nagreed, and whilst they were talking he forgot himself, and sat down\nupon the edge of the well without thinking of any evil.  But the two\nbrothers threw him backwards into the well, took the maiden, the\nhorse, and the bird, and went home to their father.  Here we bring\nyou not only the golden bird, said they, we have won the golden horse\nalso, and the maiden from the golden castle.  Then was there great\njoy, but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the\nmaiden sat and wept.\n\nBut the youngest brother was not dead.  By good fortune the well was\ndry, and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt, but he could not\nget out again.  Even in this strait the faithful fox did not leave\nhim, it came and leapt down to him, and upbraided him for having\nforgotten its advice.  But yet I cannot give up, he said, I will help\nyou up again into daylight.  He bade him grasp his tail and keep\ntight hold of it, and then he pulled him up. You are not out of all\ndanger yet, said the fox.  Your brothers were not sure of your death,\nand have surrounded the wood with watchers, who are to kill you if\nyou let yourself be seen.  But a poor man was sitting upon the road,\nwith whom the youth changed clothes, and in this way he got to the\nking's palace.\n\nNo one knew him, but the bird began to sing, the horse began to eat,\nand the beautiful maiden left off weeping.  The king, astonished,\nasked, what does this mean.  Then the maiden said, I do not know, but\nI have been so sorrowful and now I am so happy.  I feel as if my true\nbridegroom had come.  She told him all that had happened, although\nthe other brothers had threatened her with death if she were to\nbetray anything.\n\nThe king commanded that all people who were in his castle should be\nbrought before him, and amongst them came the youth in his ragged\nclothes, but the maiden knew him at once and fell upon his neck.  The\nwicked brothers were seized and put to death, but he was married to\nthe beautiful maiden and declared heir to the king.\n\nBut what happened to the poor fox.  Long afterwards the king's son\nwas once again walking in the wood, when the fox met him and said,\nyou have everything now that you can wish for, but there is never an\nend to my misery, and yet it is in your power to free me, and again\nhe asked him with tears to shoot him dead and chop off his head and\nfeet.  So he did it, and scarcely was it done when the fox was\nchanged into a man, and was no other than the brother of the\nbeautiful princess, who at last was freed from the magic charm which\nhad been laid upon him.  And now they had all the happiness they\nwanted as long as they lived.\n"
