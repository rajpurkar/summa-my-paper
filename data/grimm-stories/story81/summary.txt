In exchange for his help, the fox asks the son to shoot him and cut off his head and feet. The son refuses. On the way home, his brothers try to kill him. The fox saves the son's life and advises him how to get into his father's palace without being killed. Again the fox begs to be repaid by being shot and having his head and feet chopped off. Finally, the third son agrees to do so and when he does the fox turns into the princess's brother.
