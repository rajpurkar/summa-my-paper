A she-wolf invites a fox to be godfather of her child. The fox agrees. When the fox asks the wolf to catch food for the child, the fox lies down and rests as the wolf goes for a lamb. The wolf is caught and doused with a burning mixture. When the wolf drags herself back to the fox, the fox pretends he has been hurt by a farmer. Although the wolf can barely walk, she carries the uninjured fox to safety. When they are safe, the fox runs away laughing at the faithful wolf.
