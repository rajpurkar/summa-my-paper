S'In the days when wishing was still of some use, a king\'s son was\nbewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest.\nThere he passed many years, and no one could rescue him.  Then a\nking\'s daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could\nnot find her father\'s kingdom again.  After she had wandered about\nfor nine days, she at length came to the iron stove.\n\nThen a voice came forth from it, and asked her, "Whence do you come,\nand whither are you going?" She answered, "I have lost my father\'s\nkingdom, and cannot get home again." Then a voice inside the iron\nstove said, "I will help you to get home again, and that indeed most\nswiftly, if you will promise to do what I desire of you.  I am the\nson of a far greater king than your father, and I will marry you."\n\nThen was she afraid, and thought, "Good heavens.  What can I do with\nan iron stove?" But as she much wished to get home to her father, she\npromised to do as he desired.  But he said, "You shall return here,\nand bring a knife with you, and scrape a hole in the iron." Then he\ngave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, and in\ntwo hours he took her home.  There was great joy in the castle when\nthe king\'s daughter came home, and the old king fell on her neck and\nkissed her.  She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, "Dear\nfather, what I have suffered.  I should never have got home again\nfrom the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I\nhave been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it\nfree, and marry it."\n\nThen the old king was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he\nhad but this one daughter.  They therefore resolved they would send,\nin her place, the miller\'s daughter, who was very beautiful.  They\ntook her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the\niron stove.  So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but\ncould not bring off the least morsel of it.  When the day dawned, a\nvoice in the stove said, "It seems to me it is day outside." Then she\nanswered, "It seems so to me too, I fancy I hear the noise of my\nfather\'s mill." "So you are a miller\'s daughter.  Then go your way at\nonce, and let the king\'s daughter come here."\n\nThen she went away at once, and told the old king that the man\noutside there would have none of her - he wanted the king\'s daughter.\nThen the old king grew frightened, and the daughter wept.  But there\nwas a swine-herd\'s daughter, who was even prettier than the miller\'s\ndaughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to\nthe iron stove instead of the king\'s daughter.  So she was taken\nthither and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours.  She,\nhowever, was no better at it.  When the day broke, a voice inside the\nstove cried, "It seems to me it is day outside." Then answered she,\n"So it seems to me also, I fancy I hear my father\'s horn blowing."\n"Then you are a swineherd\'s daughter.  Go away at once, and tell the\nking\'s daughter to come, and tell her all must be done as promised,\nand if she does not come, everything in the kingdom shall be ruined\nand destroyed, and not one stone be left standing on another."\n\nWhen the king\'s daughter heard that she began to weep, but now there\nwas nothing for it but to keep her promise.  So she took leave of her\nfather, put a knife in her pocket, and went forth to the iron stove\nin the forest.  When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron\ngave way, and when two hours were over, she had already scraped a\nsmall hole. Then she peeped in, and saw a youth so handsome, and so\nbrilliant with gold and with precious jewels, that her very soul was\ndelighted.  So she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that\nhe was able to get out.\n\nThen said he, "You are mine, and I am yours, you are my bride, and\nhave released me." He wanted to take her away with him to his\nkingdom, but she entreated him to let her go once again to her\nfather, and the king\'s son allowed her to do so, but she was not to\nsay more to her father than three words, and then she was to come\nback again. So she went home, but she spoke more than three words,\nand instantly the iron stove disappeared, and was taken far away over\nglass mountains and piercing swords, but the king\'s son was set free,\nand no longer shut up in it.  After this she bade good-bye to her\nfather, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the\ngreat forest, and looked for the iron stove, but it was nowhere to be\nfound.\n\nFor nine days she sought it, and then her hunger grew so great that\nshe did not know what to do, for she had nothing to live on.  When it\nwas evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up her mind\nto spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts.  When\nmidnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light, and\nthought, ah, there I should be saved.  She got down from the tree,\nand went towards the light, but on the way she prayed.  Then she came\nto a little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a\nsmall heap of wood lay in front of it.  She thought, "Ah, whither\nhave I come?" and peeped in through the window, but she saw nothing\ninside but toads, big and little, except a table covered with wine\nand roast meat, and the plates and glasses were of silver.  Then she\ntook courage, and knocked at the door, and immediately the fat toad\ncried,\n\t"Little green waiting-maid,\n\tWaiting-maid with the limping leg,\n\tLittle dog of the limping leg,\n\tHop hither and thither,\n\tAnd quickly see who is without."\n\nAnd a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her. When she\nentered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to sit down.\nThey asked, "Where have you come from, and whither are you going?"\nThen she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had\ntransgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than\nthree words, the stove, and the king\'s son also, had disappeared, and\nnow she was about to seek him over the hill and dale until she found\nhim.  Then the old fat one said,\n\t"Little green waiting-maid,\n\tWaiting-maid with the limping leg,\n\tLittle dog of the limping leg,\n\tHop hither and thither,\n\tAnd bring me the great box."\n\nThen the little one went and brought the box.  After this they gave\nher meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like\nsilk and velvet, and she laid herself therein, in God\'s name, and\nslept.  When morning came she arose, and the old toad gave her three\nneedles out of the great box which she was to take with her, they\nwould be needed by her, for she had to cross a high glass mountain,\nand go over three piercing swords and a great lake. If she did all\nthis she would get her lover back again.\n\nThen she gave her three things, which she was to take the greatest\ncare of, namely, three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts.\nWith these she traveled onwards, and when she came to the glass\nmountain which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first\nbehind her feet and then before them, and so got over it, and when\nshe was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully.\nAfter this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated\nherslef on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them.  At last she\narrived in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she\ncame to a large and beautiful castle.  She went and asked for a\nplace, she was a poor girl, she said, and would like to be hired.\nShe knew, however, that the king\'s son whom she had released from the\niron stove in the great forest was in the castle.  Then she was taken\nas a scullery-maid at low wages.  But already the king\'s son had\nanother maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry, for he thought\nthat she had long been dead.\n\nIn the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her\npocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her.\nShe cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel when\nlo and behold there was a stately royal garment in it.  But when the\nbride heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to\nbuy it, and said, "It is not a dress for a servant-girl." "No," she\nsaid, she would not sell it, but if the bride would grant her one\nthing she should have it, and that was permission to sleep one night\nin her bridegroom\'s chamber.  The bride gave her permission because\nthe dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it.\n\nWhen it was evening she said to her bridegroom, "That silly girl will\nsleep in your room." "If you are willing, so am I," said he.  She,\nhowever, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a\nsleeping-draught.  So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to\nsleep in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken\nhim. She wept the whole night and cried, "I set you free when you\nwere in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought you, and walked\nover a glass mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake\nbefore I found you, and yet you will not hear me." The servants sat\nby the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the whole night\nthrough, and in the morning they told it to their lord.\n\nAnd the next evening when she had washed up, she opened the second\nnut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it, and when the bride\nbeheld it, she wished to buy that also. But the girl would not take\nmoney, and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom\'s\nchamber.  The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-draught, and he\nslept so soundly that he could hear nothing.  But the scullery-maid\nwept the whole night long, and cried, "I set you free when you were\nin an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought you, and walked over a\nglass mountain, and over three sharp swords and a great lake before I\nfound you, and yet you will not hear me." The servants sat by the\nchamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through, and in\nthe morning informed their lord of it.\n\nAnd on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the\nthird nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was\nstiff with pure gold.  When the bride saw that she wanted to have it,\nbut the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the\nthird time sleep in the bridegroom\'s apartment.  The king\'s son,\nhowever, was on his guard, and threw the sleeping-draught away.  Now\nwhen she began to weep and to cry, "Dearest love, I set you free when\nyou were in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest" - the king\'s\nson leapt up and said, "You are the true one, you are mine, and I am\nyours."\n\nThereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her,\nand they took away the false bride\'s clothes so that she could not\nget up.  When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and\nwhen they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated\nthemselves on the plough-wheel, and when they got to the glass\nmountain they thrust the three needles in it, and so at length they\ngot to the little old house, but when they went inside, it was a\ngreat castle, and the toads were all disenchanted, and were king\'s\nchildren, and full of happiness.  Then the wedding was celebrated,\nand the king\'s son and the princess remained in the castle, which was\nmuch larger than the castle of their fathers.  But as the old king\ngrieved at being left alone, they fetched him away, and brought him\nto live with them, and they had two kingdoms, and lived in happy\nwedlock.\n\tA mouse did run,\n\tThis story is done.\n'
