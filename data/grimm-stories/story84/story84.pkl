S"A dog is befriended by a sparrow. The sparrow gets the dog meat and bread to eat. The dog lies down in the road for a nap while the bird watches. A waggoner drives down the road. Despite the sparrow's warning that the sparrow will make the man poor if he runs over the dog, the waggoner hits the dog with his wagon and kills it. The sparrow gets his revenge by pulling the bung from one of the two wine casks in the back of the man's wagon. Then the sparrow pecks the eyes out of one of the horses. The man tries to hit the sparrow with an ax but misses and hits his horse instead. The sparrow then attacks the other barrel of wine and the other two horses in a similar manner. The sparrow's revenge..."

S"A sheep-dog had not a good master, but, on the contrary, one who\nlet him suffer hunger.  As he could stay no longer with him, he\nwent quite sadly away.  On the road he met a sparrow who said,\nbrother dog, why are you so sad.  The dog replied, I am hungry,\nand have nothing to eat.  Then said the sparrow, dear brother,\ncome into the town with me, and I will satisy your hunger.  So\nthey went into the town together, and when they came in front\nof a butcher's shop the sparrow said to the dog, stay there, and\nI will pick a bit of meat down for you, and he alighted on the\nstall, looked about him to see that no one was observing him,\nand pecked and pulled and tore so long at a piece which lay on\nthe edge, that it slipped down.  Then the dog seized it, ran into\na corner, and devoured it.  The sparrow said, now come with me\nto another shop, and then I will get you one more piece that\nyou may be satisfied.  When the dog had devoured the second piece\nas well, the sparrow asked, brother dog, have you now had enough.\nYes, I have had meat enough, he answered, but I have had no\nbread yet.  Said the sparrow, you shall have that also, come\nwith me.  Then he took him to a baker's shop, and pecked at a\ncouple of little buns till they rolled down, and as the dog\nwanted still more, he led him to another stall, and again got\nbread for him.  When that was consumed, the sparrow said, brother\ndog, have you now had enough.  Yes, he replied, now we will walk\nawhile outside the town.\nThen they both went out on to the highway.  The weather was warm,\nhowever, and when they had walked a little way the dog said, I am\ntired, and would like to sleep.  Well, do sleep, answered the\nsparrow, and in the meantime I will seat myself on a branch.  So\nthe dog lay down on the road, and fell fast asleep.  Whilst he lay\nsleeping there, a waggoner came driving by, who had a cart with\nthree horses, laden with two barrels of wine.  The sparrow,\nhowever, saw that he was not going to turn aside, but was staying\nin the wheel track in which the dog was lying, so it cried,\nwaggoner, don't do it, or I will make you poor.  But the\nwaggoner growled to himself, you will not make me poor, and\ncracked his whip and drove the cart over the dog, and the wheels\nkilled him.  Then the sparrow cried, you have run over my brother\ndog and killed him, it shall cost you your cart and horses.  Cart\nand horses indeed, said the waggoner.  What harm can you do me.\nAnd drove onwards.  Then the sparrow crept under the cover of the\ncart, and pecked so long at the same bung-hole that he got the\nbung out, and then all the wine ran out without the driver\nnoticing it.  But once when he was looking behind him he saw that\nthe cart was dripping, and looked at the barrels and saw that one\nof them was empty.  Unfortunate fellow that am I, cried he.  Not\nunfortunate enough yet, said the sparrow, and flew on to the head\nof one of the horses and pecked his eyes out.  When the driver\nsaw that, he drew out his axe and wanted to hit the sparrow, but\nthe sparrow flew into the air, and he hit his horse on the head\nand it fell down dead.  Oh, what an unfortunate man am I, cried\nhe.  Not unfortunate enough yet, said the sparrow, and when the\ndriver drove on with the two hoses, the sparrow again crept\nunder the cover, and pecked the bung out of the second cask, so\nall the wine was spilt.  When the driver became aware of it, he\nagain cried, oh, what an unfortunate man am I.  But the sparrow\nreplied, not unfortunate enough yet, and seated himself on the\nhead of the second horse, and pecked his eyes out.  The driver\nran up to it and raised his axe to strike, but the sparrow flew\ninto the air and the blow struck the horse, which fell.  Oh, what\nan unfortunate man am I.  Not unfortunate enough yet, said the\nsparrow, and lighted on the third horse's head, and pecked out\nhis eyes.  The driver, in his rage, struck at the sparrow without\nlooking round, and did not hit him but killed his third horse\nlikewise.  Oh, what an unfortunate man am I, cried he.\nNot unfortunate enough\nyet, answered the sparrow.  Now will I make you unfortunate in\nyour home, and flew away.\nThe driver had to leave the waggon standing, and full of anger\nand vexation went home.  Ah, said he to his wife, what misfortunes\nI have had.  My wine has run out, and the horses are all three\ndead.  Alas, husband, she answered, what a malicious bird has\ncome into the house.  It has gathered together every bird there\nis in the world, and they have fallen on our corn up there, and\nare devouring it.  Then he went upstairs, and thousands and\nthousands of birds were sitting in the loft and had eaten up all\nthe corn, and the sparrow was sitting in the midst of them.\nThen the driver cried, oh, what an unfortunate man am I.\nNot unfortunate enough yet, answered the sparrow, waggoner, it\nshall cost you your life as well, and flew out.\nThen the waggoner had lost all his property, and he went\ndownstairs into the room, sat down behind the stove and was quite\nfurious and bitter.  But the sparrow sat outside in front of the\nwindow, and cried, waggoner, it shall cost you your life.  Then\nthe waggoner snatched the axe and threw it at the sparrow, but it\nonly broke the window, and did not hit the bird.  The sparrow\nnow hopped in, placed itself on the stove and cried, waggoner, it\nshall cost you your life.  The latter, quite mad and blind with\nrage, smote the stove in twain, and as the sparrow flew from one\nplace to another so it fared with all his household furniture,\nlooking-glass, benches, table, and at last the walls of his house,\nand yet he could not hit the bird.  At length, however, he caught\nit with his hand.  Then his wife said, shall I kill it.  No, cried\nhe, that would be too merciful.  It shall die much more cruelly.\nAnd he took it and swallowed it whole.  The sparrow, however,\nbegan to flutter about in his body, and fluttered up again into\nthe man's mouth, then it stretched out its head, and cried,\nwaggoner, it shall still cost you your life.  The driver gave\nthe axe to his wife, and said, wife, kill the bird in my mouth\nfor me.  The woman struck, but missed her blow, and hit the\nwaggoner square on his head, so that he fell dead.  But the\nsparrow flew up and away.\n"
