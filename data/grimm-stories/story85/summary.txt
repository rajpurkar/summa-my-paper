A hateful tailor is put in jail for beating his wife. After he serves some time, he is released with the promise he will not hit her again. Although he does not beat her, he tears out her hair and throws objects at her, such as a pair of scissors. The violence becomes so bad the neighbors come to the wife's aid. The husband tries to explain away his bad behavior by saying he was only trying to bring her back to her duty by throwing things at her. The judges see through the man's lame excuses and punish him according to his actions.
