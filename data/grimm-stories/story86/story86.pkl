S'A certain miller had little by little fallen into poverty, and\nhad nothing left but his mill and a large apple-tree behind\nit.  Once when he had gone into the forest to fetch wood, an\nold man stepped up to him whom he had never seen before, and\nsaid, why do you plague yourself with cutting wood, I will\nmake you rich, if you will promise me what is standing behind\nyour mill.  What can that be but my apple-tree, thought the\nmiller, and said, yes, and gave a written promise to the\nstranger.  He, however, laughed mockingly and said, when three\nyears have passed, I will come and carry away what belongs to me,\nand then he went.  When the miller got home, his wife came to\nmeet him and said, tell me, miller, from whence comes this\nsudden wealth into our house.  All at once every box and chest\nwas filled, no one brought it in, and I know not how it\nhappened.  He answered, it comes from a stranger who met me in\nthe forest, and promised me great treasure.  I\' in return,\nhave promised him what stands behind the mill - we can very\nwell give him the big apple-tree for it.  Ah, husband, said the\nterrified wife, that must have been the devil.  He did not mean the\napple-tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill\nsweeping the yard.\n\nThe miller\'s daughter was a beautiful, pious girl, and lived\nthrough the three years in the fear of God and without sin.  When\ntherefore the time was over, and the day came when the evil one\nwas to fetch her, she washed herself clean, and made a circle\nround herself with chalk.  The devil appeared quite early, but\nhe could not come near to her.  Angrily, he said to the miller,\ntake all water away from her, that she may no longer be able to\nwash herself, for otherwise I have no power over her.  The\nmiller was afraid, and did so.  The next morning the devil came\nagain, but she had wept on her hands, and they were quite\nclean.  Again he could not get near her, and furiously said to\nthe miller, cut her hands off, or else I have no power over\nher.  The miller was shocked and answered, how could I cut off my\nown child\'s hands.  Then the evil one threatened him and said,\nif you do not do it you are mine, and I will take you yourself.\n\nThe father became alarmed, and promised to obey him.  So he\nwent to the girl and said, my child, if I do not cut off both\nyour hands, the devil will carry me away, and in my terror\nI have promised to do it.  Help me in my need, and forgive me\nthe harm I do you.  She replied, dear father, do with me what\nyou will, I am your child.  Thereupon she laid down both her\nhands, and let them be cut off.  The devil came for the third\ntime, but she had wept so long and so much on the stumps, that\nafter all they were quite clean.  Then he had to give in, and\nhad lost all right over her.\n\nThe miller said to her, I have by means of you received such\ngreat wealth that I will keep you most handsomely as long as\nyou live.  But she replied, here I cannot stay, I will go forth,\ncompassionate people will give me as much as I require.\n\nThereupon she caused her maimed arms to be bound to her back,\nand by sunrise she set out on her way, and walked the whole day\nuntil night fell.  Then she came to a royal garden, and by\nthe shimmering of the moon she saw that trees covered with\nbeautiful fruits grew in\nit, but she could not enter, for it was surrounded by water.\nAnd as she had walked the whole day and not eaten one mouthful,\nand hunger tormented her, she thought, ah, if I were but inside,\nthat I might eat of the fruit, else must I die of hunger.  Then\nshe knelt down, called on God the Lord, and prayed.  And\nsuddenly an angel came towards her, who made a dam in the water,\nso that the moat became dry and she could walk through it.  And\nnow she went into the garden and the angel went with her.  She\nsaw a tree covered with beautiful pears, but they were all\ncounted.  Then she went to them, and to still her hunger, ate\none with her mouth from the tree, but no more.  The gardener\nwas watching, but as the angel was standing by, he was afraid\nand thought the maiden was a spirit, and was silent, neither\ndid he dare to cry out, or to speak to the spirit.  When she had\neaten the pear, she was satisfied, and went and concealed herself\namong the bushes.  The king to whom the garden belonged, came\ndown to it next morning, and counted, and saw that one of the\npears was missing, and asked the gardener what had become of it,\nas it was not lying beneath the tree, but was gone.  Then\nanswered the gardener, last night, a spirit came in, who had no\nhands, and ate off one of the pears with its mouth.  The king\nsaid, how did the spirit get over the water, and where did it go\nafter it had eaten the pear.  The gardener answered, someone\ncame in a snow-white garment from heaven who made a dam, and\nkept back the water, that the spirit might walk through the moat.\nAnd as it must have been an angel, I was afraid, and asked\nno questions, and did not cry out.  When the spirit had eaten\nthe pear, it went back again.  The king said, if it be as you\nsay, I will watch with you to-night.\n\nWhen it grew dark the king came into the garden and brought\na priest with him, who was to speak to the spirit.  All three\nseated themselves beneath the tree and watched.  At midnight the\nmaiden came creeping out of the thicket, went to the tree, and\nagain ate one pear off it with her mouth, and beside her stood\nthe angel in white garments.  Then the priest went out to them\nand said, "Do you come from heaven or from earth?  Are you a\nspirit, or a human\nbeing?"  She replied, "I am no spirit, but an unhappy mortal\ndeserted by all but God."  The king said, "If you are forsaken\nby all the world, yet will I not forsake you."  He took her with\nhim into his royal palace, and as she was so beautiful and good,\nhe loved her with all his heart, had silver hands made for her,\nand took her to wife.\n\nAfter a year the king had to go on a journey, so he commended\nhis young queen to the care of his mother and said, if she\nis brought to child-bed take care of her, nurse her well,\nand tell me of it at once in a letter.  Then she gave birth to\na fine boy.  So the old mother made haste to write and announce\nthe joyful news to him.  But the messenger rested by a brook\non the way, and as he was fatigued by the great distance, he\nfell asleep.  Then came the devil, who was always seeking to\ninjure the good queen, and exchanged the letter for another, in\nwhich was written that the queen had brought a monster into\nthe world.  When the king read the letter he was shocked and\nmuch troubled, but he wrote in answer that they were to take\ngreat care of the queen and nurse her well until his arrival.\n\nThe messenger went back with the letter, but rested at the\nsame place and again fell asleep.  Then came the devil\nonce more, and put a different letter in his pocket, in which\nit was written that they were to put the queen and her child to\ndeath.  The old mother was terribly shocked when she received\nthe letter, and could not believe it.  She wrote back again to\nthe king, but received no other answer, because each time the\ndevil substituted a false letter, and in the last letter it was\nalso written that she was to preserve the queen\'s tongue and\neyes as a token that she had obeyed.\n\nBut the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to\nbe shed, and had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue\nand eyes, and kept them.  Then said she to the queen, "I cannot\nhave you killed as the king commands, but here you may stay\nno longer.  Go forth into the wide world with your child, and\nnever come here again."  The poor woman tied her child on her back,\nand went away with eyes full of tears.  She came into a great wild\nforest, and then she fell on her knees and prayed to God, and the\nangel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a little house\non which was a sign with the words, here all dwell free.  A\nsnow-white maiden came out of the little house and said, welcome,\nlady queen, and conducted her inside.  Then she unbound the\nlittle boy from her back, and held him to her breast that he might\nfeed, and laid him in a beautifully-made little bed.  Then\nsaid the poor woman, "From whence do you know that I was a queen?"\n\nThe white maiden answered, "I am an angel sent by God, to watch\nover you and your child."  The queen stayed seven years in the\nlittle house, and was well cared for, and by God\'s grace, because\nof her piety, her hands which had been cut off, grew once more.\n\nAt last the king came home again from his journey, and his first\nwish was to see his wife and the child.  Then his aged mother\nbegan to weep and said, "You wicked man, why did you write to me\nthat I was to take those two innocent lives," and she showed him\nthe two letters which the evil one had forged, and then\ncontinued, "I did as you bade me, and she showed the tokens, the\ntongue and eyes."  Then the king began to weep for his poor wife\nand his little son so much more bitterly than she was doing,\nthat the aged mother had compassion on him and said, "be at peace,\nshe still lives, I secretly caused a hind to be killed, and\ntook these tokens from it, but I bound the child to your wife\'s\nback and bade her go forth into the wide world, and made her\npromise never to come back here again, because you were so\nangry with her."  Then spoke the king, "I will go as far as\nthe sky is blue, and will neither eat nor drink until I have\nfound again my dear wife and my child, if in the meantime they\nhave not been killed, or died of hunger."\n\nThereupon the king traveled about for seven long years, and\nsought her in every cleft of the rocks and in every cave, but\nhe found her not, and thought she had died of want.  During the\nwhole time he neither ate nor drank, but God supported him.  At\nlength he came into a great forest, and found therein the little\nhouse whose sign was, here all dwell free.  Then forth came\nthe white maiden, took him by the hand, led him in, and said,\n"Welcome, lord king," and asked him from whence he came.  He\nanswered, "Soon shall I have traveled about for the space of\nseven years, and I seek my wife and her child, but cannot find\nthem."  The angel offered him meat and drink, but he did not\ntake anything, and only wished to rest a little.  Then he lay\ndown to sleep, and laid a handkerchief over his face.\n\nThereupon the angel went into the chamber where the queen\nsat with her son, whom she usually called Sorrowful, and\nsaid to her, go out with your child, your husband has come.  So\nshe went to the place where he lay, and the handkerchief\nfell from his face.  Then said she, "Sorrowful, pick up your\nfather\'s handkerchief, and cover his face again."  The child picked\nit up, and put it over his face again.  The king in his sleep\nheard what passed, and had pleasure in letting the handkerchief\nfall once more.  But the child grew impatient, and said,\n"Dear mother, how can I cover my father\'s face when I have no\nfather in this world.  I have learnt to say the prayer - Our\nFather, which art in heaven - you have told me that my father\nwas in heaven, and was the good God, and how can I know a wild\nman like this.  He is not my father."  When the king heard that,\nhe got up, and asked who they were.  Then said\nshe, "I am your wife, and that is your son, Sorrowful".  And he\nsaw her living hands, and said, "My wife had silver hands."  She\nanswered, "The good God has caused my natural hands to grow again,"\nand the angel went into the inner room, and brought the silver\nhands, and showed them to him.  Hereupon he knew for a certainty\nthat it was his dear wife and his dear child, and he kissed\nthem, and was glad, and said, "A heavy stone has fallen from off\nmy heart."  Then the angel of God ate with them once again, and\nafter that they went home to the king\'s aged mother.  There were\ngreat rejoicings everywhere, and the king and queen were married\nagain, and lived contentedly to their happy end.\n'
