S"Three tailors set about to win the heart of a haughty princess. When they arrive, the youngest tailor is the only one able to guess the answer to the princess's riddle. After correctly guessing the riddle, the young tailor learns he must also survive the night with a bear. The tailor tricks the bear into thinking he will give the bear violin lessons. The tailor tells the bear his nail must be cut, and locks the bear's paws in a vice. The tailor and his bride ride to the church in a carriage. The other two tailors unlock the bear so he is free to run after the carriage and get his revenge on the tailor. The tailor stands on his hands so that his legs appear to be a vise and threatens to re-apprehend the bear. The bear runs away..."

S'There was once upon a time a princess who was extremely proud. If a\nwooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not\nguess it, he was sent contemptuously away.  She let it be made known\nalso that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be\nwho he might.  At length, three tailors fell in with each other, the\ntwo eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous jobs of\nwork successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also,\nthe third was a little, useless harum-scarum, who did not even know\nhis trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for\nwhere else was it to come from.  Then the two others said to him,\njust stay at home, you cannot do much with your little understanding.\nThe little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and\nsaid he had set his mind to work on this for once, and he would\nmanage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his.\n\nThey all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was\nto propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now\ncome, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a\nneedle.  Then said the princess, "I have two kinds of hair on my\nhead, of what color is it." "If that be all," said the first, "it\nmust be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and\nsalt." The princess said, "Wrongly guessed, let the second answer."\nThen said the second, "If it be not black and white, then it is brown\nand red, like my father\'s sunday coat." "Wrongly guessed," said the\nprincess, "let the third give the answer for I see very well he knows\nit for certain." Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and\nsaid, "The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and\nthose are the two different colors."\n\nWhen the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down\nwith terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she\nhad firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it.  When her\ncourage returned she said, "You have not won me yet by that.  There\nis still something else that you must do.  Below, in the stable is a\nbear with which you shall pass the night, and when I get up in the\nmorning if you are still alive, you shall marry me." She expected,\nhowever, she would thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never\nyet left anyone alive who had fallen into his clutches.  The little\ntailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite\ndelighted, and said, "Boldly ventured is half won."\n\nSo when the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the\nbear.  The bear was about to set on the little fellow at once, and\ngive him a hearty welcome with his paws.  "Softly, softly," said the\nlittle tailor, "I will soon make you quiet." Then quite composedly,\nand as if he had no anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of\nhis pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels.  When the bear saw\nthat, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too.  The tailor\nfelt in his pockets, and reached him a handful, they were, however,\nnot nuts, but pebbles.  The bear put them in his mouth, but could get\nnothing out of them, let him bite as he would.  "Eh," thought he,\n"what a stupid blockhead am I, I cannot even crack a nut." And then\nhe said to the tailor, "Here, crack me the nuts." "There, see what a\nstupid fellow you are," said the little tailor, "to have such a great\nmouth, and not be able to crack a small nut." Then he took the pebble\nand nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it\nwas in two.  "I must try the thing again," said the bear, "when I\nwatch you, I then think I ought to be able to do it too." So the\ntailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to\nbite into it with all the strength of his body.  But even you do not\nbelieve that he managed it.\n\nWhen that was over, the tailor took out a violin from beneath his\ncoat, and played something to himself.  When the bear heard the\nmusic, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a\nwhile, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little\ntailor, "Listen, is it difficult to fiddle?" "Easy enough for a\nchild.  Look, with the left hand I lay my fingers on it, and with the\nright I stroke it with the bow, and then it goes merrily, hop sa sa\nvivallalera." "So," said the bear, "fiddling is a thing I should like\nto learn too, that I might dance whenever I felt like it.  What do\nyou think of that?  Will you give me lessons?" "With all my heart,"\nsaid the tailor, "if you have a talent for it.  But just let me see\nyour claws, they are terribly long, I must cut your nails a little."\nThen a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the\nlittle tailor screwed it tight, and said, "Now wait until I come with\nthe scissors." And he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in\nthe corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.\n\nWhen the princess heard the bear growling so fiercely during the\nnight, she believed nothing else but that he was growling for joy,\nand had made an end of the tailor.  In the morning she arose careless\nand happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood\ngaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water.  Now she\ncould not say another word against the wedding because she had given\na promise before everyone, and the king ordered a carriage to be\nbrought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and\nthere she was to be married.\n\nWhen they had climbed into the carriage, the two other tailors, who\nhad false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the\nstable and unscrewed the bear again.  The bear in great fury ran\nafter the carriage.  The princess heard snorting and growling.  She\nwas terrified, and she cried, "Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to\nget you." The tailor was quick and stood on his head, stuck his legs\nout of the window, and cried, "Do you see the vise?  If you do not be\noff you shall be put into it again." When the bear saw that, he\nturned round and ran away.  The tailor drove quietly to church, and\nthe princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as\nhappy as a woodlark.  Whosoever does not believe this, must pay a\ntaler.\n'
