S"There was once upon a time a man who was called frederick\nand a woman called catherine, who had married each other\nand lived together as young married folks.  One day\nfrederick said, I will now go and plough, catherine, when\nI come back, there must be some roast meat on the table for\nhunger, and a fresh draught for thirst.  Just go, frederick,\nanswered kate, just go, I will have all ready for you.  So when\ndinner-time drew near she got a sausage out of the chimney, put\nit in the frying-pan, put some butter to it, and set it on the\nfire.  The sausage began to fry and to hiss, catherine stood\nbeside it and held the handle of the pan, and had her own\nthoughts as she was doing it.  Then it occurred to her, while\nthe sausage is getting done you could go into the cellar and draw\nbeer.  So she set the frying-pan safely on the fire, took a can,\nand went down into the cellar to draw beer.  The beer ran\ninto the can and kate watched it, and then she thought, oh,\ndear.  The dog upstairs is not fastened up, it might get the\nsausage out of the pan.  Lucky I thought of it.  And in a trice\nshe was up the cellar-steps again, but the spitz had the sausage\nin its mouth already, and trailed it away on the ground.  But\ncatherine, who was not idle, set out after it, and chased it a\nlong way into the field, the dog, however, was swifter than\ncatherine and did not let the sausage go, but skipped over\nthe furrows with it.  What's gone is gone, said kate, and\nturned round, and as she had run till she was weary, she walked\nquietly and comfortably, and cooled herself.  During this time\nthe beer was still running out of the cask, for kate had not\nturned the tap.  And when the can was full and there was no\nother place for it, it ran into the cellar and did not stop until\nthe whole cask was empty.  As soon as kate was on the steps she\nsaw the accident.  Good\ngracious, she cried.  What shall I do now to stop frederick\nfinding out.  She thought for a while, and at last she remembered\nthat up in the garret was still standing a sack of the finest\nwheat flour from the last fair, and she would fetch that down and\nstrew it over the beer.  Yes, said she, he who saves a thing\nwhen he ought, has it afterwards when he needs it, and she climbed\nup to the garret and carried the sack below, and threw it straight\ndown on the can of beer, which she knocked over, and frederick's\ndraught swam also in the cellar.  It is all right, said kate,\nwhere the one is the other ought to be also, and she strewed\nthe meal over the whole cellar.  When it was done she was heartily\ndelighted with her work, and said, how clean and wholesome it does\nlook here.  At mid-day home came frederick, now, wife, what\nhave you ready for me.  Ah, freddy, she answered, I was frying\na sausage for you, but whilst I was drawing the beer to drink\nwith it, the dog took it away out of the pan, and whilst I was\nrunning after the dog, all the beer ran out, and whilst I was\ndrying up the beer with the flour, I knocked over the can as\nwell, but be easy, the cellar is quite dry again.  Said\nfrederick, kate, kate, you should not have done that, to let\nthe sausage be carried off and the beer run out of the cask,\nand throw out all our flour into the bargain.  Well, frederick,\nI did not know that, you should have told me.  The man thought,\nif this is the kind of wife I have, I had better take more care\nof things.  Now he had saved up a good number of talers\nwhich he changed into gold, and said to catherine, look,\nthese are yellow counters for playing games, I will put\nthem in a pot and bury them in the stable under the cow's manger,\nbut mind you keep away from them, or it will be the worse for\nyou.  Said she, oh, no, frederick, I certainly will not go\nnear them.  And when frederick was gone some pedlars came into\nthe village who had cheap earthen bowls and pots, and asked\nthe young woman if there was nothing she wanted to bargain with\nthem for.  Oh, dear people, said catherine, I have no money\nand can buy nothing, but if you have any use for yellow\ncounters I will buy of you.  Yellow counters, why not.  But\njust let us see them.  Then go into the stable and\ndig under the cow's manger, and you will find the yellow\ncounters.  I am not allowed to go there.  The rogues went\nthither, dug and found pure gold.  Then they laid hold of it,\nran away, and left their pots and bowls behind in the house.\nCatherine though she must use her new things, and as she had\nno lack in the kitchen already without these, she knocked the\nbottom out of every pot, and set them all as ornaments on the\npaling which went round about the house.  When frederick came\nand saw the new decorations, he said, catherine, what have you\nbeen about.  I have bought them, frederick, for the counters\nwhich were under the cow's manger.  I did not go there myself,\nthe pedlars had to dig them out for themselves.  Ah, wife,\nsaid frederick, what have you done.  Those were not counters,\nbut pure gold, and all our wealth, you should not have done that.\nIndeed, frederick, said she, I did not know that, you should\nhave forewarned me.\nCatherine stood for a while and wondered, then she said,\nlisten, frederick, we will soon get the gold back again, we\nwill run after the thieves.  Come, then, said frederick, we\nwill try it, but take with you some butter and cheese that we may\nhave something to eat on the way.  Yes, frederick, I will take\nthem.  They set out, and as frederick was the better walker,\ncatherine followed him.  It is to my advantage, thought she,\nwhen we turn back I shall be a little way in advance.  Then\nshe came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both sides\nof the road.  There one can see, said catherine, how they\nhave torn and skinned and galled the poor earth, it will never\nbe whole again as long as it lives, and in her heart's\ncompassion she took her butter and smeared the ruts right\nand left, that they might not be so hurt by the wheels, and as\nshe was thus bending down in her charity, one of the cheeses\nrolled out of her pocket down the hill.  Said catherine, I\nhave made my way once up here, I will not go down again, another\nmay run and fetch it back.  So she took another cheese and rolled\nit down.  But the cheeses did not come back, so she let a third\nrun down, thinking.  Perhaps they are waiting for company, and\ndo not like to walk alone.  As all three stayed away she said,\nI do not know what that\ncan mean, but it may perhaps be that the third has not found\nthe way, and has gone wrong, I will just send the fourth to\ncall it.  But the fourth did no better than the third.  Then\ncatherine was angry, and threw down the fifth and sixth as\nwell, and these were her last.  She remained standing for some\ntime watching for their coming, but when they still did not come,\nshe said, oh, you are good folks to send in search of death,\nyou stay a fine long time away.  Do you think I will wait any\nlonger for you.  I shall go my way, you may run after me,\nyou have younger legs than I.  Catherine went on and found\nfrederick, who was standing waiting for her because he wanted\nsomething to eat.  Now just let us have what you have brought\nwith you, said he.  She gave him the dry bread.  Where have\nyou the butter and the cheeses, asked the man.  Ah, freddy,\nsaid catherine, I smeared the cart-ruts with the butter and\nthe cheeses will come soon, one ran away from me, so I sent\nthe others after to call it.  Said frederick, you should not\nhave done that, catherine, to smear the butter on the road,\nand let the cheeses run down the hill.  Really, frederick,\nyou should have told me.\nThen they ate the dry bread together, and frederick said,\ncatherine, did you make the house safe when you came away.\nNo, frederick, you should have told me to do it before.  Then\ngo home again, and make the house safe before we go any farther,\nand bring with you something else to eat.  I will wait here\nfor you.  Catherine went back and thought, frederick wants\nsomething more to eat, he does not like butter and cheese, so I\nwill take with me a handkerchief full of dried pears and\na pitcher of vinegar for him to drink.  Then she bolted the\nupper half of the door fast, but unhinged the lower door, and\ntook it on her back, believing that when she had placed the\ndoor in security the house must be well taken care of.  Catherine\ntook her time on the way, and thought, frederick will rest\nhimself so much the longer.  When she had once reached him she\nsaid, here is the house-door for you, frederick, and now you\ncan take care of the house yourself.  Oh, heavens, said he, what\na wise wife I have.  She takes the under-door\noff the hinges that everything may run in, and bolts the\nupper one.  It is now too late to go back home again, but\nsince you have brought the door here, you shall just carry it\nfarther.  I will carry the door, frederick, but the dried pears\nand the vinegar-jug will be too heavy for me, I will hang them\non the door, it may carry them.\nAnd now they went into the forest, and sought the rogues, but\ndid not find them.  At length as it grew dark they climbed into\na tree and resolved to spend the night there.  Scarcely, however,\nhad they sat down at the top of it than the rascals came thither\nwho carry away with them what does not want to go, and find\nthings before they are lost.  They sat down under the very tree\nin which frederick and catherine were sitting, lighted a fire,\nand were about to share their booty.  Frederick got down on the\nother side and collected\nsome stones together.  Then he climbed up again with them, and\nwished to throw them at the thieves and kill them.  The stones,\nhowever, did not hit them, and the knaves cried, it will soon\nbe morning, the wind is shaking down the fir-cones.  Catherine\nstill had the door on her back, and as it pressed so heavily on\nher, she thought it was the fault of the dried pears, and said,\nfrederick, I must throw the pears down.  No, catherine, not now,\nhe replied, they might betray us.  Oh, but, frederick, I must.\nThey weigh me down far too much.  Do it, then, and be hanged.\nThen the dried pears rolled down between the branches, and the\nrascals below said, those are birds, droppings.\nA short time afterwards, as the door was still heavy, catherine\nsaid, ah, frederick, I must pour out the vinegar.  No, catherine,\nyou must not, it might betray us.  Ah, but, frederick, I must,\nit weighs me down far too much.  Then do it and be hanged.\nSo she emptied out the vinegar, and it spattered over the\nrobbers.  They said amongst themselves, the dew is already\nfalling.  At length catherine thought, can it really be the\ndoor which weighs me down so, and said, frederick, I must\nthrow the door down.  No, not now, catherine, it might betray us.\nOh, but, frederick, I must.  It weighs me down far too much.  Oh,\nno, catherine, do hold it fast.  Ah, frederick, I am letting it\nfall.  Let it go, then, in the devil's name.  Then it fell down\nwith a violent clatter, and the rascals below cried, the devil is\ncoming down the tree, and they ran away and left everything behind\nthem.  Early next morning, when the two came down they found all\ntheir gold again, and carried it home.\nWhen they were once more at home, frederick said, and now,\ncatherine, you, too, must be industrious and work.  Yes,\nfrederick, I will soon do that, I will go into the field and\ncut corn.  When catherine got into the field, she said to\nherself, shall I eat before I cut, or shall I sleep before I\ncut.  Oh, I will eat first.  Then catherine ate and eating made\nher sleepy, and she began to cut, and half in a dream cut all her\nclothes to pieces, her apron, her gown, and her shift.  When\ncatherine awoke again after a long sleep she was standing\nthere half-naked, and said to herself, is it I, or is it not\nI.  Alas, it is not I.  In the meantime night came, and catherine\nran into the village, knocked at her husband's window, and cried,\nfrederick.\nWhat is the matter.  I should very much like to know if catherine\nis in.  Yes, yes, replied frederick, she must be in and asleep.\nSaid she, that's all right, then I am certainly at home already,\nand ran away.\nOutside catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal.\nThen she went to them and said, I will help you to steal.  The\nrascals thought that she knew what opportunities the place\noffered, and were willing.  Catherine went in front of the houses,\nand cried, good folks, have you anything.  We want to steal.\nThe thieves thought to themselves, that's a fine way of doing\nthings, and wished themselves once more rid of catherine.  Then\nthey said to her, outside the village the pastor has some turnips\nin the field.  Go there and pull up some turnips for us.\nCatherine went to the ground, and began to pull them up, but\nwas so lazy that she never stood up straight.  Then a man came\nby, saw her, and stood still and thought that it was the devil\nwho was thus rooting amongst the turnips.  He ran away into the\nvillage to the pastor, and said, mr. Pastor, the devil is in\nyour turnip-ground, rooting up turnips.  Ah, heavens, answered\nthe pastor, I have a lame foot, I cannot go out and drive him\naway.  Said the man, then I will carry you on my back, and he\ncarried him out on his back.  And when they came to the ground,\ncatherine arose and stood up her full height.  Ah, the devil,\ncried the pastor, and both hurried away, and in his great\nfright the pastor could run better with his lame foot than the\nman who had carried him on his back could do on his sound legs.\n"
