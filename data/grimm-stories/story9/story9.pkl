S'In a time when machines and birds alike spoke in languages that could be understood, all birds of the world gathered together to decide which bird should be king. They first decide the bird that can fly the highest will be king. The eagle flies higher than all the other birds. Just as the eagle thinks he had won, a bird without a name climbs out of the breast feathers of the eagle and flies all the way up to heaven. The birds say this little fellow cannot be king because he won by trickery. Therefore, they devise another trial. They decide the bird who can go lowest will be king. This time the little bird with no name crawls down a mouse hole and therefore is lower than all the other birds. The other birds decided to set the owl in front of the...'

S'In olden times every sound still had its meaning and significance.\nWhen the smith\'s hammer resounded, it cried, "Strike away, strike\naway."  When the carpenter\'s plane grated, it said, "Here goes, here\ngoes."  If the mill wheel began to clack, it said, "Help, Lord God,\nhelp, Lord God."  And if the miller was a cheat and set the mill\na-going, it spoke high german, and first asked slowly, "Who is\nthere?  Who is there?"  And then answered quickly, "The miller,\nthe miller."  And at last quite in a hurry, "He steals bravely,\nHe steals bravely, three pecks in a bushel."\n\nAt this time the birds also had their own language which every\none understood.  Now it only sounds like chirping, screeching, and\nwhistling, and sometimes like music without words.  It came into\nthe birds\' mind, however, that they would no longer be without a\nruler, and would choose one of themselves to be their king.  One\nalone among them, the green plover, was opposed to this.  He\nhad lived free and would die free, and anxiously flying hither\nand thither, he cried, "Where shall I go?  Where shall I go?"  He\nretired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself\nno more among his fellows.\n\nThe birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine may\nmorning they all gathered together from the woods and fields,\neagles and chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how\ncan I name them all.  Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his\nclerk, who is so called because he is always heard a few days\nbefore him, and a very small bird which as yet had no name,\nmingled with the band.  The hen, which by some accident had\nheard nothing of the whole matter, was astonished at the great\nassemblage.  What, what, what is going to be done, she cackled.\nBut the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said, only a lot of\nrich people, and told her what they had on hand.  It was\ndecided that the one who could fly the highest should be king.\nA tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard\nthat, cried a warning, no, no, no, no, because he thought that\nmany tears would be shed because of this.  But the crow said, caw,\ncaw, and that all would pass off peaceably.\n\nIt was now determined that on this fine morning they should at\nonce begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able\nto say, I could easily have flown much higher, but the evening\ncame on, and I could do no more.  On a given signal, therefore,\nthe whole troop rose up in the air.  The dust ascended from the\nland, and there was tremendous fluttering and whirring and\nbeating of wings, and it looked as if a black cloud was rising\nup.  The little birds were soon left behind.  They could go no\nfarther, and fell back to the ground.  The larger birds held\nout longer, but none could equal the\neagle, who mounted so high that he could have plucked the eyes\nout of the sun.  And when he saw that the others could not get\nup to him, he thought, why should you fly still higher.  You are\nthe king, and began to let himself down again.  The birds beneath\nhim at once cried to him, you must be our king, no one has flown\nso high as you.  Except me, screamed the little fellow without a\nname, who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle.  And\nas he was not at all tired, he rose up and mounted so high that\nhe reached heaven itself.  However, when he had gone as far as\nthis, he folded his wings together, and called down with clear\nand penetrating voice, I am king.  I am king.\nYou, our king, cried the birds angrily.  You have managed it\nby trick and cunning.  So they made another condition.  He\nshould be king who could go down lowest in the ground.  How\nthe goose did flap about with its broad breast when it was once\nmore on land.  How quickly the cock scratched a hole.  The\nduck came off the worst of all, for she leapt into a ditch,\nbut sprained her legs, and waddled away to a neighboring pond,\ncrying, cheating, cheating.  The little bird without a name,\nhowever, sought out a mouse-hole, slipped down into it, and\ncried out of it with his small voice, I am king.  I am king.\nYou our king, cried the birds still more angrily.  Do you\nthink your cunning shall prevail.  They determined to keep him\na prisoner in the hole and starve him out.  The owl was placed\nas sentinel in front of it, and was not to let the rascal out\nif she had any value for her life.  When evening was come and all\nthe birds were feeling very tired after the exertion of so much\nflying, they went to bed with their wives and children.\nThe owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole, gazing\nsteadfastly into it with her great eyes.  Then she, too, grew\ntired and thought to herself, you might certainly shut one eye,\nyou will still watch with the other, and the little villain\nshall not come out of his hole.  So she shut one eye,\nand with the other looked straight at the mouse-hole.  The\nlittle fellow put his head out and peeped, and wanted to slip\naway, but the owl came forward immediately, and he drew his head\nback again.  Then the owl opened the one eye again, and shut the\nother, intending to shut them in turn all through the\nnight.  But when she next shut the one eye, she forgot to open\nthe other, and as soon as both her eyes were shut she\nfell asleep.  The little fellow soon observed that, and slipped\naway.\nFrom that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by\ndaylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her\nfeathers out.  She flies out only by night, but hates and\npursues mice because they make such ugly holes.  The little\nbird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen,\nbecause he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught.\nHe steals about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he\nsometimes cries, I am king, and for this reason, the other\nbirds call him in mockery, king of the hedges.  No one, however,\nwas so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little\nking.  As soon as the sun appears, she ascends high in the air\nand cries, ah, how beautiful that is.  Beautiful that is.\nBeautiful\'beautiful.  Ah, how beautiful that is.\n'
