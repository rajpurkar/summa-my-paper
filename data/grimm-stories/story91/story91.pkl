S"Once upon a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb,\nand did not become any bigger, and during several years did not grow\none hair's breadth.  Once when the father was going out to plough,\nthe little one said, father, I will go out with you. You would go out\nwith me, said the father.  Stay here, you will be of no use out\nthere, besides you might get lost.  Then thumbling began to cry, and\nfor the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket, and took him\nwith him.\n\nWhen he was outside in the field, he took him out again, and set him\nin a freshly cut furrow.  Whilst he sat there, a great giant came\nover the hill.  Do you see that great bogie, said the father, for he\nwanted to frighten the little fellow to make him behave well, he is\ncoming to fetch you.  The giant, however, had scarcely taken two\nsteps with his long legs before he was in the furrow.\n\nHe took up little thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him,\nand without saying one word went away with him. His father stood by,\nbut could not utter a sound for terror, and he thought nothing else\nbut that his child was lost, and that as long as he lived he should\nnever set eyes on him again.\n\nBut the giant carried him home, let him suckle at his breast, and\nthumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants.\nWhen two years had passed, the old giant took him into the forest,\nwanted to test him, and said, pull up a stick for yourself.  Then the\nboy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the\nearth by the roots.  But the giant thought, we must do better than\nthat, took him back again, and suckled him two years longer.  When he\ntested him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an\nold tree out of the ground.\n\nThat was still not enough for the giant, he again suckled him for two\nyears, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, now\njust tear up a real stick, the boy tore up the biggest oak-tree from\nthe earth, so that it cracked, and that was a mere trifle to him.\nNow that will do, said the giant, you are perfect.  And took him back\nto the field from whence he had brought him.  His father was there\nfollowing the plough.  The young giant went up to him, and said, does\nmy father see what a fine man his son has grown into.\n\nThe farmer was alarmed, and said, no, you are not my son.  I don't\nwant you - leave me.  Truly I am your son, allow me to do your work,\nI can plough as well as you, nay better.  No, no, you are not my son,\nand you can not plough - go away.  However, as he was afraid of this\ngreat man, he let go of the plough, stepped back and sat down at the\nside of the land.  Then the youth took the plough, and just grasped\nit with one hand, but his pressure was so strong that the plough went\ndeep into the earth.\n\nThe farmer could not bear to see that, and called to him, if you are\ndetermined to plough, you must not press so hard on it, that makes\nbad work.  The youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the\nplough himself, saying, just go home, father, and bid my mother make\nready a large dish of food, and in the meantime I will go over the\nfield.  Then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare\nthe food, but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large,\nquite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and\nharrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once.  When he\nhad done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees,\nlaid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind\nand one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried\nall as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents, house.\n\nWhen he entered the yard, his mother did not recognize him, and\nasked, who is that horrible tall man.  The father said, that is our\nson.  She said, no that cannot be our son, we never had such a tall\none, ours was a little thing.  She called to him, go away, we do not\nwant you.  The youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable,\ngave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted.  When he had\ndone this, he went into the parlor, sat down on the bench and said,\nmother, now I should like something to eat, will it soon be ready?\nShe said, yes, and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which\nwould have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week.\nThe youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had\nnothing more to set before him.  No, she replied, that is all we\nhave.  But that was only a taste, I must have more.\n\nShe did not dare to oppose him, and went and put a huge pig's trough\nfull of food on the fire, and when it was ready, carried it in.  At\nlength come a few crumbs, said he, and gobbled all there was, but it\nwas still not sufficient to appease his hunger.  Then said he,\nfather, I see well that with you I shall never have food enough, if\nyou will get me an iron staff which is strong, and which I cannot\nbreak against my knees, I will go out into the world.  The farmer was\nglad, put his two horses in his cart, and fetched from the smith a\nstaff so large and thick, that the two horses could only just bring\nit away.\n\nThe youth laid it across his knees, and snap, he broke it in two in\nthe middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away. The father then\nharnessed four horses, and brought a bar which was so long and thick,\nthat the four horses could only just drag it.  The son snapped this\nalso in twain against his knees, threw it away, and said, father,\nthis can be of no use to me, you must harness more horses, and bring\na stronger staff.  So the father harnessed eight horses, and brought\none which was so long and thick, that the eight horses could only\njust carry it. When the son took it in his hand, he immediately\nsnapped off the end of it, and said, father, I see that you will not\nbe able to procure me any such staff as I want, I will remain no\nlonger with you.\n\nSo he went away, and gave out that he was a smith's apprentice. He\narrived at a village, wherein lived a smith who was a stingy fellow,\nwho never did a kindness to any one, but wanted everything for\nhimself.  The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a\njourneyman.  Yes, said the smith, and looked at him, and thought,\nthat is a strong fellow who will strike out well, and earn his bread.\nSo he asked, how much wages do you want.\n\nI don't want any at all, he replied, only every fortnight, when the\nother journeymen are paid, I will give you two blows, and you must\nbear them.  The miser was heartily satisfied, and thought he would\nthus save much money.  Next morning, the strange journeyman was to\nbegin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the\nyouth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil\nsank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again.\nThen the miser grew angry, and said, oh, but I can't make any use of\nyou, you strike far too powerfully.  How much will you have for the\none blow.\n\nThen said he, I will give you only quite a small blow, that's all.\nAnd he raised his foot, and gave him such a kick that he flew away\nover four loads of hay.  Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in\nthe smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went\nonwards.\n\nWhen he had walked for some time, he came to a small farm, and asked\nthe bailiff if he did not require a head-man.  Yes, said the bailiff,\nI can make use of one.  You look a capable fellow who can do\nsomething, how much a year do you want as wages.  He again replied\nthat he wanted no wages at all, but that every year he would give him\nthree blows, which he must bear.  Then the bailiff was satisfied, for\nhe, too, was a covetous fellow.  Next morning all the servants were\nto go into the wood, and the others were already up, but the head-man\nwas still in bed.  Then one of them called to him, get up, it is\ntime, we are going into the wood, and you must go with us.  Ah, said\nhe quite roughly and surlily, you may just go, then, I shall be back\nagain before any of you.  Then the others went to the bailiff, and\ntold him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go\ninto the wood with them.  The bailiff said they were to awaken him\nagain, and tell him to harness the horses.  The head-man, however,\nsaid as before, just go there, I shall be back again before any of\nyou.  And then he stayed in bed two hours longer.  At length he arose\nfrom the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from\nthe loft, made himself some broth, ate it at his leisure, and when\nthat was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the\nwood.\n\nNot far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so\nhe first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind\nthe cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so\nthat no horse could get through.  When he was entering the wood, the\nothers were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go\nhome.  Then said he to them, drive on, I will still get home before\nyou do.  He did not drive far into the wood, but at once tore two of\nthe very largest trees of all out of the earth, threw them on his\ncart, and turned round.  When he came to the barricade, the others\nwere still standing there, not able to get through.  Don't you see,\nsaid he, that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just\nas quickly, and would have had another hour's sleep.  He now wanted\nto drive on, but his horeses could not work their way through, so he\nunharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts\nin his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as\neasily as if it had been laden with feathers. When he was over, he\nsaid to the others, there, you see, I have got over quicker than you.\nAnd drove on, and the others had to stay where they were.  In the\nyard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff,\nand said, isn't that a fine cord of wood.\n\nThen said the bailiff to his wife, the servant is a good one - even\nif he does sleep long, he is still home before the others.  So he\nserved the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other\nservants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to\ntake his too.  The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he\nwas to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having\nthem, for rather than that, he himself would be head-man, and the\nyouth should be bailiff.  No said he, I will not be a bailiff, I am\nhead-man, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we\nagreed on.  The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he\ndemanded, but it was of no use, the head-man said no to everything.\n\nThen the bailiff did not know what to do, and begged for a\nfortnight's delay, for he wanted to find some way of escape. The\nhead-man consented to this delay.  The bailiff summoned all his\nclerks together, and they were to think the matter over, and give him\nadvice.  The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said\nthat no one was sure of his life with head-man, for he could kill a\nman as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get\ninto the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would\nroll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on\nhis head, and then he would never return to daylight.\n\nThe advice pleased the bailiff, and the head-man was quite willing to\ngo down the well.  When he was standing down below at the bottom,\nthey rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken\nhis skull, but he cried, chase away those hens from the well, they\nare scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my\neyes, so that I can't see.  So the bailiff cried, sh-sh, - and\npretended to frighten the hens away.  When the head-man had finished\nhis work, he climbed up and said, just look what a beautiful neck-tie\nI have on.  And behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing\nround his neck.\n\nThe head-man now wanted to take his reward, but the bailiff again\nbegged for a fortnight's delay.  The clerks met together and advised\nhim to send the head-man to the haunted mill to grind corn by night,\nfor from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive.\n\nThe proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-man that very\nevening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill,\nand grind it that night, for it was wanted.  So the head-man went to\nthe loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his\nleft, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his\nbreast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill.  The miller told him\nthat he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the\nmill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone\ninto it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside.  He\nsaid, I will manage it, just you go and put your head on the pillow.\n\nThen he went into the mill, and poured out the corn.  About eleven\no'clock he went into the miller's room, and sat down on the bench.\nWhen he had sat there a while, a door suddenly opened, and a large\ntable came in, and on the table, wine and roasted meats placed\nthemselves, and much good food besides, but everything came of\nitself, for no one was there to carry it.\n\nAfter this the chairs pushed themselves up, but no people came, until\nall at once he beheld fingers, which handled knives and forks, and\nlaid food on the plates, but with this exception he saw nothing.  As\nhe was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table,\nate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.  When he had had\nenough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he\ndistinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as\nit was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear.  Then\nhe said, if anything of that kind comes again, I shall strike out in\nreturn.  And when he had received a second box on the ear, he, too\nstruck out.\n\nAnd so it continued the whole night.  He took nothing without\nreturning it, but repaid everything with interest, and did not slay\nabout him in vain.  At daybreak, however, everything ceased.  When\nthe miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if\nhe were still alive.  Then the youth said, I have given some in\nreturn.  The miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released\nfrom the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward.  But\nhe said, money, I will not have, I have enough of it.  So he took his\nmeal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done\nwhat he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on.\n\nWhen the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite\nbeside himself.  He walked to and fro in the room, and drops of sweat\nran down from his forehead.  Then he opened the window to get some\nfresh air, but before he was aware, the head-man had given him such a\nkick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far\naway that no one ever saw him again.\n\nThen said the head-man to the bailiff's wife, if he does not come\nback, you must take the other blow.  She cried, no, no I cannot bear\nit.  And opened the other window, because drops of sweat were running\ndown her forehead.  Then he gave her such a kick that she, too, flew\nout, and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband.\nHer husband cried, do come to me, but she replied, come you to me, I\ncannot come to you.\n\nAnd they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each\nother, and whether they are still hovering about or not, I do not\nknow, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way.\n"
