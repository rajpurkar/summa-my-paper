S"A man orders his wife not to sell their cows for less than two hundred talers. The cattle buyer agrees to the bargain, but as he doesn't have his money with him, he leaves one of the cows as promise of payment. When the husband finds his wife has made a silly bargain, he lifts his stick to beat her, but instead decides to try to find if there are people more silly than her. He meets a woman and her son whom he tricks into believing he has fallen from heaven. He is able to take from them money and a horse. They believe he is giving it to their relative in heaven. He comments that if stupidity always brought such great reward, he would honor it more. "

S"One day a peasant took his good hazel-stick out of the corner\nand said to his wife, trina, I am going across country, and\nshall not return for three days.  If during that time the\ncattle-dealer should happen to call and want to buy our three\ncows, you may strike a bargain at once, but not unless you can\nget two hundred talers for them, nothing less, do you hear.  For\nheaven's sake, just go in peace, answered the woman, I will\nmanage that.  You, indeed, said the man.  You once fell on your\nhead when you were a little child, and that affects you even now,\nbut let me tell you this, if you do anything foolish, I will\nmake your back black and blue, and not with paint, I assure\nyou, but with the stick which I have in my hand, and the coloring\nshall last a whole year, you may rely on that.  And having said\nthat, the man went on his way.\n\nNext morning the cattle-dealer came, and the woman had no\nneed to say many words to him.  When he had seen the cows and heard\nthe price, he said, I am quite willing to give that.  Honestly\nspeaking, they are worth it.  I will take the beasts away with\nme at once.  He unfastened their chains and drove them out of\nthe byre, but just as he was going out of the yard-door, the\nwoman clutched him by the sleeve and said, you must give me the\ntwo hundred talers now, or I cannot let the cows go.  True, answered the man,\nbut I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt.  Have no fear,\nhowever, you shall have security for my paying.  I will take two\ncows with me and leave one, and then you will have a good pledge.\n\nThe woman saw the force of this, and let the man go away\nwith the cows, and thought to herself, how pleased Hans will be\nwhen he finds how cleverly I have managed it.  The peasant came\nhome on the third day as he had said he would, and at once inquired\nif the cows were sold.  Yes, indeed, dear Hans, answered the\nwoman, and as you said, for two hundred talers.  They are scarcely\nworth so much, but the man took them without making any objection.\nWhere is the money, asked the peasant.  Oh, I have not got the\nmoney, replied the woman, he had happened to forget his money-belt,\nbut he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him.\nWhat kind of security, asked the man.  One of the three cows, which\nhe shall not have until he has paid for the other two.  I have\nmanaged very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats\nthe least.  The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was\njust going to give her the beating he had promised her, when\nsuddenly he let the stick fail and said, you\nare the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God's earth, but\nI am sorry for you.  I will go out into the highways and wait for\nthree days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you.\nIf I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not\nfind him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any\ndiscount.\n\nHe went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and\nwaited for what would happen.  Then he saw a peasant's waggon\ncoming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the\nmiddle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which\nwas lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them.\n\nThe man thought to himself, that is certainly one of the kind I\nam in search of, and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in\nfront of the waggon like one who is not in his right mind.  What\ndo you want, my friend, said the woman to him.  I don't know you,\nwhere do you come from.  I have fallen down from heaven, replied\nthe man, and don't know how to get back again, couldn't you drive\nme up.  No, said the woman, I don't know the way, but if you come\nfrom heaven you can surely tell me how my husband is, who has been\nthere these three years.  You must have seen him.  Oh, yes, I\nhave seen him, but all men can't get on well.  He keeps sheep,\nand the sheep give him a great deal to do.  They run up the\nmountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and he has to run\nafter them and drive them together again.  His clothes are\nall torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his body.  There is\nno tailor there, for saint peter won't let any of them in, as you\nknow by the story.  Who would have thought it, cried the woman, I\ntell you what, I will fetch his sunday coat which is still hanging\nat home in the cupboard.  He can wear that and look respectable.\nYou will be so kind as to take it with you.  That won't do very\nwell, answered the peasant, people are not allowed to take clothes\ninto heaven, they are taken away at the gate.  Then listen, said\nthe woman, I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of\nmoney for it, I will send that to him.  If you hide the purse in\nyour pocket, no one will know that you have it.  If you can't\nmanage it any other way, said the peasant, I will do you that\nfavor.  Just\nsit still where you are, said she, and I will drive home and fetch\nthe purse, I shall soon be back again.  I do not sit down on the\nbundle of straw, but stand up in the waggon, because it makes it\nlighter for the cattle.\n\nShe drove her oxen away, and the peasant\nthought, that woman has a perfect talent for folly, if she really\nbrings the money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she\nwill get no beating.  It was not long before she came in a great\nhurry with the money, and with her own hands put it in his pocket.\nBefore she went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for\nhis courtesy.\n\nWhen the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in\nfrom the field.  She told him what unexpected things had befallen\nher, and then added, I am truly delighted at having found an\nopportunity of sending something to my poor husband.  Who would\never have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything\nup in heaven.  The son was full of astonishment.  Mother, said he,\nit is not every day that a man comes from heaven in this way, I\nwill go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found, he\nmust tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.\n\nHe saddled the horse and rode off with all speed.  He found the\npeasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was about to\ncount the money in the purse.  Have you seen the man who has\nfallen down from heaven, cried the youth to him.  Yes, answered the\npeasant, he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up\nthat hill, from whence it will be rather nearer, you could still\ncatch him up, if you were to ride fast.  Alas, said the youth, I\nhave been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has\ncompletely worn me out, you know the man, be so kind as to get on\nmy horse, and go and persuade him to come here.  Aha, thought the\npeasant, here is another who has not a brain in his head.  Why\nshould I not do you this favor, said he, and mounted the horse and\nrode off at a quick trot.  The youth remained sitting there till\nnight fell, but the peasant never came back.  The man from heaven\nmust certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,\nthought he, and the peasant has no doubt given\nhim the horse to take to my father.  He went home and told his\nmother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the\nhorse so that he might not have to be always running about.  You\nhave done well, answered she, your legs are younger than his, and\nyou can go on foot.\n\nWhen the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside\nthe cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and\nsaid, trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who\nare still sillier fools than you, this time you escape without\na beating.  I will store it up for another occasion.  Then he\nlighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather's chair, and said,\nit was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great\npurse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows.  If\nstupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite\nwilling to hold it in honor.  So thought the peasant, but you\nno doubt prefer simpletons.\n"
