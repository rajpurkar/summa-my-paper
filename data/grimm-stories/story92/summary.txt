A man orders his wife not to sell their cows for less than two hundred talers. The cattle buyer agrees to the bargain, but as he doesn't have his money with him, he leaves one of the cows as promise of payment. When the husband finds his wife has made a silly bargain, he lifts his stick to beat her, but instead decides to try to find if there are people more silly than her. He meets a woman and her son whom he tricks into believing he has fallen from heaven. He is able to take from them money and a horse. They believe he is giving it to their relative in heaven. He comments that if stupidity always brought such great reward, he would honor it more.
