S'A father cannot decide which son should get his house when he dies. He has his sons learn trades. When they return, the one who shows him the greatest masterpiece will be the one who wins the house. The first son shaves the whiskers off a running hare without injuring the hare. The second son puts shoes on a horse while it is galloping. The third has learned from a fencing master. It begins to rain and the boy twirls his sword above his head so quickly none of the drops hit him. The father exclaims this is the masterpiece and grants the youngest the house. The brothers live together in the house after their father passes away. When the brothers grow old and one dies, the others are so sad they die also and are buried together in the same grave. '

S'There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the\nworld but the house in which he lived.  Now each of the sons wished\nto have the house after his father\'s death, but the father loved them\nall alike, and did not know what to do, he did not wish to sell the\nhouse, because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have\ndivided the money amongst them. At last he conceived a plan, and he\nsaid to his sons, "Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a\ntrade, and, when you all come back, he who makes the best masterpiece\nshall have the house."\n\nThe sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be\na blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master.\nThey fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each\nwent his way.\n\nIt chanced that they all found skillful masters, who taught them\ntheir trades well.  The blacksmith had to shoe the king\'s horses, and\nhe thought to himself, "The house is mine, without doubt." The barber\nshaved only distinguished people, and he too already looked upon the\nhouse as his own.  The fencing-master suffered many a blow, but he\ngrit his teeth, and let nothing vex him, for, said he to himself, "If\nyou are afraid of a blow, you\'ll never win the house."\n\nWhen the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back\nhome to their father, but they did not know how to find the best\nopportunity for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted\ntogether.  As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running\nacross the field.  Ah, ha, just in time, said the barber.  So he took\nhis basin and soap, and lathered away until the hare drew near, then\nhe soaped and shaved off the hare\'s whiskers whilst he was running at\nthe top of his speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair\non his body. "Well done," said the old man. "If the others do not\nmake a great effort, the house is yours."\n\nSoon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full\nspeed.  "Now you shall see what I can do, father," said the\nblacksmith.  So away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off\nthe feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put on\nfour new shoes without stopping him.  "You are a fine fellow, and as\nclever as your brother," said his father.  "I do not know to which I\nought to give the house."\n\nThen the third son said, "Father, let me have my turn, if you\nplease," and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and\nflourished it backwards and forwards above his head so fast that not\na drop fell upon him.  It rained still harder and harder, till at\nlast it came down in torrents, but he only flourished his sword\nfaster and faster, and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a\nhouse.  When his father saw this he was amazed, and said, "This is\nthe masterpiece, the house is yours."\n\nHis brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand, and,\nas they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together\nin the house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so\nwell and were so clever, they earned a great deal of money.  Thus\nthey lived together happily until they grew old, and at last, when\none of them fell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely\nabout it that they also fell ill, and soon after died.  And because\nthey had been so clever, and had loved one another so much, they were\nall laid in the same grave.\n'
