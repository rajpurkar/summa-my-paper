A father cannot decide which son should get his house when he dies. He has his sons learn trades. When they return, the one who shows him the greatest masterpiece will be the one who wins the house. The first son shaves the whiskers off a running hare without injuring the hare. The second son puts shoes on a horse while it is galloping. The third has learned from a fencing master. It begins to rain and the boy twirls his sword above his head so quickly none of the drops hit him. The father exclaims this is the masterpiece and grants the youngest the house. The brothers live together in the house after their father passes away. When the brothers grow old and one dies, the others are so sad they die also and are buried together in the same grave.
