S'There was once a poor woman who had two children.  The youngest\nhad to go every day into the forest to fetch wood.  Once when\nshe had gone a long way to seek it, a little child, who\nwas quite strong, came and helped her industriously to pick up\nthe wood and carry it home, and then before a moment had passed\nthe strange child disappeared.  The child told her mother this,\nbut at first she would not believe it.  At length she brought\na rose home, and told her mother that the beautiful child had\ngiven her this\nrose, and had told her that when it was in full bloom, he would\nreturn.  The mother put the rose in water.  One morning her\nchild could not get out of bed.  The mother went to the bed and\nfound her dead, but she lay looking very happy.  On the same\nmorning, the rose was in full bloom.\n'
