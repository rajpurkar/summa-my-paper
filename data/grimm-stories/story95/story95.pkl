S"As a result of injury, a solider is dismissed from the king's service with no pay and no way to support himself. He meets up with a witch. The witch allows him to do work for her. The witch asks the soldier to go down into a well to retrieve a blue light. The soldier does so but refuses to give it to her until she pulls him fully out of the well. This angers this witch.

S'There was once on a time a soldier who for many years had served the\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no\nlonger because of the many wounds which he had received.  The king\nsaid to him, "You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and\nyou will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who\nrenders me serve for them." Then the soldier did not know how to earn\na living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until\nin the evening he entered a forest.  When darkness came on, he saw a\nlight, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a\nwitch.  "Do give me one night\'s lodging, and a little to eat and\ndrink," said he to her, "or I shall starve." "Oho," she answered,\n"who gives anything to a run-away soldier?  Yet will I be\ncompassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish." "What do\nyou wish?" said the soldier.  "That you should dig all round my\ngarden for me, tomorrow." The soldier consented, and next day labored\nwith all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening.  "I\nsee well enough," said the witch, "that you can do no more today, but\nI will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must\ntomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small." The soldier\nspent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch\nproposed that he should stay one night more.  "Tomorrow, you shall\nonly do me a very trifling piece of work.  Behind my house, there is\nan old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and\nnever goes out, and you shall bring it up again."\n\nNext day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a\nbasket.  He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him\nup again.  She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she\nstretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from\nhim.  "No," said he, perceiving her evil intention, "I will not give\nyou the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground."\nThe witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and\nwent away.\n\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the\nblue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him.  He saw\nvery well that he could not escape death.  He sat for a while very\nsorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his\ntobacco pipe, which was still half full.  "This shall be my last\npleasure," thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and\nbegan to smoke.  When the smoke had circled about the cavern,\nsuddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said, "Lord, what\nare your commands?" "What my commands are?" replied the soldier,\nquite astonished.  "I must do everything you bid me," said the little\nman. "Good," said the soldier, "then in the first place help me out\nof this well." The little man took him by the hand, and led him\nthrough an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the\nblue light with him.  On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures\nwhich the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took\nas much gold as he could carry.  When he was above, he said to the\nlittle man, "Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the\njudge."\n\nIn a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat\nand screaming frightfully.  Nor was it long before the little man\nre-appeared.  "It is all done," said he, "and the witch is already\nhanging on the gallows.  What further commands has my lord," inquired\nthe dwarf.  "At this moment, none," answered the soldier, "You can\nreturn home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you." "Nothing\nmore is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue\nlight, and I will appear before you at once." Thereupon he vanished\nfrom his sight.\n\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he had come.  He went to\nthe best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the\nlandlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was\nready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the\nlittle black mannikin and said, "I have served the king faithfully,\nbut he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to\ntake my revenge." "What am I to do?" asked the little man.  "Late at\nnight, when the king\'s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her\nsleep, she shall do servant\'s work for me." The mannikin said, "That\nis an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you,\nfor if it is discovered, you will fare ill." When twelve o\'clock had\nstruck, the door sprang open, and the mannikin carried in the\nprincess.  "Aha, are you there?" cried the soldier, "Get to your work\nat once.  Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber." When she had done\nthis, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out\nhis feet and said, "Pull off my boots," and then he threw them in her\nface, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them.\nShe, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition,\nsilently and with half-shut eyes.  When the first cock crowed, the\nmannikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her\nbed.\n\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\nhim that she had had a very strange dream.  "I was carried through\nthe streets with the rapidity of lightning," said she, "and taken\ninto a soldier\'s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant,\nsweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work.  It\nwas only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done\neverything." "The dream may have been true," said the king, "I will\ngive you a piece of advice.  Fill your pocket full of peas, and make\na small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again,\nthey will fall out and leave a track in the streets." But unseen by\nthe king, the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that, and\nheard all.  At night when the sleeping princess was again carried\nthrough the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket,\nbut they made no track, for the crafty mannikin had just before\nscattered peas in every street there was.  And again the princess was\ncompelled to do servant\'s work until cock-crow.\n\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it\nwas all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting,\npicking up peas, and saying, "It must have rained peas, last night."\n"We must think of something else," said the king, "keep your shoes on\nwhen you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you\nare taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it."\nThe black mannikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier\nagain ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told\nhim that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and\nthat if the shoe were found in the soldier\'s house it would go badly\nwith him.  "Do what I bid you," replied the soldier, and again this\nthird night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but\nbefore she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.\n\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter\'s\nshoe.  It was found at the soldier\'s, and the soldier himself, who at\nthe entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought\nback, and thrown into prison.  In his flight he had forgotten the\nmost valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had\nonly one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was\nstanding at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of\nhis comrades passing by.  The soldier tapped at the pane of glass,\nand when this man came up, said to him, "Be so kind as to fetch me\nthat small bundle I have lying in the inn, and I will give you a\nducat for doing it."\n\nHis comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted.  As soon as\nthe soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the\nblack mannikin.  "Have no fear," said the latter to his master.  "Go\nwheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take\nthe blue light with you." Next day the soldier was tried, and though\nhe had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death.  When\nhe was led forth to die, he begged a last favor of the king.  "What\nis it?" asked the king.  "That I may smoke one more pipe on my way."\n"You may smoke three," answered the king, "but do not imagine that I\nwill spare your life." Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and\nlighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke\nhad ascended, the mannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand,\nand said, "What does my lord command?" "Strike down to earth that\nfalse judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has\ntreated me so ill." Then the mannikin fell on them like lightning,\ndarting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched\nby his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again.  The\nking was terrified, he threw himself on the soldier\'s mercy, and\nmerely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his\nown, and his daughter to wife.\n'
