S"A mother makes her stepdaughter jump into the well after the girl accidentally drops her shuttle into the well. The girl wakes in a large meadow where she does work that needs to be done. Finally she comes to the house of a little old woman. The girl stays and works for this woman until realizes she is sad and missing her home. Mother Holle leads the girl to a large door, hands her the shuttle, and then showers the girl with a gold covering. The mother's daughter wants to be blessed as well, so she jumps into the well also. This girl, however, does not do the work that needs to be done, and in the end Mother Holle showers this girl with pitch instead of gold. "

S"There was once a widow who had two daughters - one of\nwhom was pretty and industrious, whilst the other was ugly\nand idle.  But she was much fonder of the ugly and idle one,\nbecause she was her own daughter.  And the other, who was a\nstep-daughter, was obliged to do all the work, and be the\ncinderella of the house.  Every day the poor girl had to sit by a\nwell, in the highway, and spin and spin till her fingers bled.\nNow it happened that one day the shuttle was marked with her\nblood, so she dipped it in the well, to wash the mark off, but it\ndropped out of her hand and fell to the bottom.  She began to\nweep, and ran to her step-mother and told her of the mishap.  But\nshe scolded her sharply, and was so merciless as to say, since\nyou have let the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again.\nSo the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do.\nAnd in the sorrow of her heart she jumped into the well to get the\nshuttle.  She lost her senses.  And when she awoke and came to\nherself again, she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was\nshining and many thousands of flowers were growing.  Across this\nmeadow she went, and at last came to a baker's oven full of bread,\nand the bread cried out, oh, take me out. Take me out. Or I shall\nburn.  I have been baked a long time.  So she went up to it, and\ntook out all the loaves one after another with the bread-shovel.\nAfter that she went on till she came to a tree covered with apples,\nwhich called out to her,  oh, shake me. Shake me. We apples are\nall ripe.  So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain,\nand went on shaking till they were all down, and when she had\ngathered them into a heap, she went on her way.\nAt last she came to a little house, out of which an old woman\npeeped.  But she had such large teeth that the girl was\nfrightened, and was about to run away.  But the old woman called\nout to her, what are you afraid of, dear child.  Stay with me.\nIf you will do all the work in the house properly, you shall be\nthe better for it.  Only you must take care to make my bed well,\nand shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly - for then there\nis snow on the earth.  I am mother holle.\nAs the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took courage\nand agreed to enter her service.  She attended to everything to the\nsatisfaction of her mistress, and always shook her bed so vigorously\nthat the feathers flew about like snow-flakes.  So she had a\npleasant life with her.  Never an angry word.  And to eat she had\nboiled or roast meat every day.\nShe stayed some time with mother holle, before she became sad.\nAt first she did not know what was the matter with her, but found\nat length that it was home-sickness.  Although she was many thousand\ntimes better off here than at home, still she had a longing to be\nthere.  At last she said to the old woman, I have a longing for\nhome, and however well off I am down here, I cannot stay any\nlonger.  I must go up again to my own people.  Mother holle said,\nI am pleased that you long for your home again, and as you have\nserved me so truly, I myself will take you up again.  Thereupon\nshe took her by the hand, and led her to a large door.  The door\nwas opened, and just as the maiden was standing beneath the\ndoorway, a heavy shower of golden rain fell, and all the gold clung\nto her, so that she was completely covered over with it.\nYou shall have that because you have been so industrious, said\nmother holle, and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle\nwhich she had let fall into the well.  Thereupon the door closed,\nand the maiden found herself up above upon the earth, not far\nfrom her mother's house.\nAnd as she went into the yard the cock was sitting on the well,\nand cried -\n     cock-a-doodle-doo.\n     Your golden girl's come back to you.\nSo she went in to her mother, and as she arrived thus covered with\ngold, she was well received, both by her and her sister.\nThe girl told all that had happened to her, and as soon as the\nmother heard how she had come by so much wealth, she was very\nanxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter.\nShe had to seat herself by the well and spin.  And in order that\nher shuttle might be stained with blood, she stuck her hand into a\nthorn bush and pricked her finger.  Then she threw her shuttle\ninto the well, and jumped in after it.\nShe came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow and walked\nalong the very same path.  When she got to the oven the bread again\ncried, oh, take me out. Take me out. Or I shall burn.  I have been\nbaked a long time.  But the lazy thing answered, as if I had any\nwish to make myself dirty. And on she went.  Soon she came to the\napple-tree, which cried, oh, shake me. Shake me. We apples are all\nripe.  But she answered, I like that.  One of you might fall on\nmy head, and so went on.  When she came to mother holle's house\nshe was not afraid, for she had already heard of her big teeth, and\nshe hired herself to her immediately.\nThe first day she forced herself to work diligently, and obeyed\nmother holle when she told her to do anything, for she was thinking\nof all the gold that she would give her.  But on the second day\nshe began to be lazy, and on the third day still more so, and then\nshe would not get up in the morning at all.  Neither did she make\nmother holle's bed as she ought, and did not shake it so as to\nmake the feathers fly up.  Mother holle was soon tired of this, and\ngave her notice to leave.  The lazy girl was willing enough to go,\nand thought that now the golden rain would come.  Mother holle led\nher also to the great door, but while she was standing beneath it,\ninstead of the gold a big kettleful of pitch was emptied over her.\nThat is the reward for your service, said mother holle, and shut\nthe door.\nSo the lazy girl went home, but she was quite covered with pitch,\nand the cock on the well, as soon as he saw her, cried out -\n     cock-a-doodle-doo.\n     Your dirty girl's come back to you.\nBut the pitch clung fast to her, and could not be got off as long\nas she lived.\n"
