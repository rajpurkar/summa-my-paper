A mother makes her stepdaughter jump into the well after the girl accidentally drops her shuttle into the well. The girl wakes in a large meadow where she does work that needs to be done. Finally she comes to the house of a little old woman. The girl stays and works for this woman until realizes she is sad and missing her home. Mother Holle leads the girl to a large door, hands her the shuttle, and then showers the girl with a gold covering. The mother's daughter wants to be blessed as well, so she jumps into the well also. This girl, however, does not do the work that needs to be done, and in the end Mother Holle showers this girl with pitch instead of gold.
