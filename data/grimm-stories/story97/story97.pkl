S'A servant waits on his master faithfully for three years without asking any wages. At the end of his three years the servant decides to go out and see the world. He asks for his wages. His miserly master gives him three farthings. The servant meets a dwarf who asks for the three farthings since the servant is still able to work. The servant gives him the money, and in exchange the dwarf grants the servant three wishes. The servant wishes for a gun that will hit anything at which he aims, a fiddle that will cause all who hears its music to dance and people to give him anything for which he asks. These wishes are granted. The servant meets a Jew. The Jew is listening to a bird sing and wishing for the bird. The servant takes his gun...'

S"There was once a rich man, who had a servant who served him\ndiligently and honestly.  He was every morning the first out of\nbed, and the last to go to rest at night, and whenever there was\na difficult job to be done, which nobody cared to undertake, he\nwas always the first to set himself to it.  Moreover, he never\ncomplained, but was contented with everything and always merry.\nWhen a year was ended, his master gave him no wages, for he said\nto himself, that is the cleverest way, for I shall save something\nand he will not go away, but stay quietly in my service.  The\nservant said nothing, but did his work the second year as he had\ndone it the first, and when at the end of this, likewise, he\nreceived no wages, he submitted and still stayed on.\nWhen the third year also was past, the master considered, put his\nhand in his pocket, but pulled nothing out.  Then at last the\nservant said, master, for three years I have served you honestly,\nbe so good as to give me what I ought to have, for I wish to\nleave, and look about me a little more in the world.\nYes, my good fellow, answered the old miser, you have served me\nindustriously, and therefore you shall be graciously rewarded.\nAnd he put his hand into his pocket, but counted out only three\nfarthings, saying, there, you have a farthing for each year, that\nis large and liberal pay, such as you would have received from\nfew masters.\nThe honest servant, who understood little about money, put his\nfortune into his pocket, and thought, ah, now that I have my\npurse full, why need I trouble and plague myself any longer with\nhard work.  So on he went, up hill and down dale, and sang and\njumped to his heart's content.  Now it came to pass that as he\nwas going by a thicket a little man stepped out, and called to\nhim, whither away, merry brother.  I see you do not carry many\ncares.  Why should I be sad, answered the servant, I have enough.\nThree years, wages are jingling in my pocket.\nHow much is your treasure, the dwarf asked him.  How much.  Three\nfarthings sterling, all told.  Look here, said the dwarf, I am a\npoor needy man, give me your three farthings, I can work no longer\nbut you are young, and can easily earn your bread.\nAnd as the servant had a good heart, and felt pity for the little\nman, he gave him the three farthings, saying, take them in the\nname of heaven, I shall not be any the worse for it.\nThen the little man said, as I see you have a good heart I grant\nyou three wishes, one for each farthing, they shall all be\nfulfilled.  Aha, said the servant, you are one of those who can\nwork wonders.  Well, then, if it is to be so, I wish, first, for\na gun, which shall hit everything that I aim at, secondly, for a\nfiddle, which when\nI play on it, shall compel all who hear it to dance, thirdly, that\nif I ask a favor of any one he shall not be able to refuse it.\nAll that shall you have, said the dwarf, and put his hand into the\nbush, and just imagine, there lay a fiddle and gun, all ready,\njust as if they had been ordered.  These he gave to the servant,\nand then said to him, whatever you may ask at any time, no man in\nthe world shall be able to deny you.\nHeart alive.  What more can one desire, said the servant, to\nhimself, and went merrily onwards.  Soon afterwards he met a Jew\nwith a long goat's beard, who was standing listening to the song\nof a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree.  Good\nheavens, he was exclaiming, that such a small creature should have\nsuch a fearfully loud voice.  If it were but mine.  If only\nsomeone would sprinkle some salt upon its tail.  If that is all,\nsaid the servant, the bird shall soon be down here.  And taking\naim he blew, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes.  Go,\nyou rogue, he said to the Jew, and fetch the bird out for\nyourself.\nOh, said the Jew, leave out the rogue, my master, and I will do it\nat once.  I will get the bird out for myself, now that you have\nhit it.  Then he lay down on the ground, and began to crawl\ninto the thicket.\nWhen he was fast among the thorns, the good servant's humor\nso tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play.  In a\nmoment the Jew's legs began to move, and to jump into the air, and\nthe more the servant fiddled the better went the dance.  But the\nthorns tore his shabby coat from him, combed his beard, and\npricked and plucked him all over the body.  Oh, dear, cried the\nJew, what do I want with your fiddling.  Leave the fiddle alone\nmaster, I do not want to dance.\nBut the servant did not listen to him, and thought, you have\nfleeced people often enough, now the thorn-bushes shall do the\nsame to you.  And he began to play over again, so that the Jew\nhad to jump higher than ever, and scraps of his coat were left\nhanging on the thorns.  Oh, woe's me, cried the Jew, I will give\nthe gentleman whatsoever he asks if only he leaves off fiddling,\na whole purseful of gold.  If you are so liberal, said the servant,\nI will stop my music, but this I must say to your credit, that\nyou dance to it so well that one must really admire it.  And\nhaving taken the purse he went his way.\nThe Jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was\nfar off and out of sight, and then he screamed out with all his\nmight, you miserable musician, you beer-house fiddler.  Wait till\nI catch you alone, I will hunt you till the soles of your shoes\nfall off.  You ragamuffin, just put six farthings in your mouth,\nthat you may be worth three halfpence.  And went on abusing him as\nfast as he could speak.  As soon as he had refreshed himself a\nlittle in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town\nto the justice.\nMy lord judge, he said, I have come to make a complaint, see how\na rascal has robbed and ill-treated me on the public highway.  A\nstone on the ground might pity me, my clothes all torn, my body\npricked and scratched, my little all gone with my purse - good\nducats, each piece better than the last, for God's sake let the\nman be thrown into prison.\nWas it a soldier, said the judge, who cut you thus with his\nsabre.  Nothing of the sort, said the Jew, it was no sword that he\nhad, but a gun hanging at his back, and a fiddle at his neck, the\nwretch may easily be recognized.\nSo the judge sent his people out after the man, and they found the\ngood servant, who had been going quite slowly along, and they\nfound, too, the purse with the money upon him.  As soon as he\nwas taken before the judge he said, I did not touch the Jew, nor\ntake his money, he gave it to me of his own free will, that I\nmight leave off fiddling because he could not bear my music.\nHeaven defend us, cried the Jew, his lies are as thick as flies\nupon the wall.\nBut the judge also did not believe his tale, and said, this is\na bad defence, no Jew would do that.  And because he had committed\nrobbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be\nhanged.  As he was being led away the Jew again screamed after\nhim, you vagabond.  You dog of a fiddler.  Now you are going to\nreceive your well-earned reward.  The servant walked quietly with\nthe hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round\nand said to the judge, grant me just one request before I die.\nYes, if you do not ask your life, said the judge.\nI do not ask for life, answered the servant, but as a last favor\nlet me play once more upon my fiddle.\nThe Jew raised a great cry of, murder.  Murder.  For goodness,\nsake do not allow it.  Do not allow it.  But the judge said, why\nshould I not let him have this short pleasure.  It has been\ngranted to him, and he shall have it.  However, he could not have\nrefused on account of the gift which had been bestowed on the\nservant.\nThen the Jew cried, oh.  Woe's me.  Tie me, tie me fast.  While\nthe good servant took his fiddle from his neck, and made ready.\nAs he gave the first scrape, they all began to quiver and shake,\nthe judge, his clerk, and the hangman and his men, and the cord\nfell out of the hand of the one who was going to tie the Jew\nfast.  At the second scrape they all leaped up and began to\ndance, the judge and the Jew being the best at jumping.  Soon all\nwho had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing\nwith them, old and young, fat and lean, one with another.  The\ndogs, likewise, which had run there, got up on their hind legs\nand capered about, and the longer he played, the higher sprang\nthe dancers, so that they knocked against each other's heads\nand began to shriek terribly.\nAt length the judge cried, quite of breath, I will give you your\nlife if you will only stop fiddling.  The good servant thereupon\nhad compassion, took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again,\nand stepped down the ladder.  Then he went up to the Jew, who was\nlying upon the ground panting for breath, and said, you rascal,\nnow confess, whence you got the money, or I will take my fiddle\nand begin to play again.  I stole it, I stole it, cried he, but\nyou have honestly earned it.  So the judge had the Jew taken\nto the gallows and hanged as a thief.\n"
