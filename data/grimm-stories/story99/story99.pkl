S"In a certain country there was once great lamentation over a\nwild boar that laid waste the farmer's fields, killed the cattle,\nand ripped up people's bodies with his tusks.  The king promised\na large reward to anyone who would free the land from this plague,\nbut the beast was so big and strong that no one dared to go near\nthe forest in which it lived.  At last the king gave notice\nthat whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have\nhis only daughter to wife.\n\nNow there lived in the country two brothers, sons of a poor man,\nwho declared themselves willing to undertake the hazardous\nenterprise, the elder, who was crafty and shrewd, out of pride,\nthe younger, who was innocent and simple, from a kind heart.\nThe king said, in order that you may be the more sure of finding\nthe beast, you must go into the forest from opposite sides.  So\nthe elder went in on the west side, and the younger on the east.\nWhen the younger had gone a short way, a little man stepped\nup to him.  He held in his hand a black spear and said, I give\nyou this spear because your heart is pure and good, with this\nyou can boldly attack the wild boar, and it will do you no harm.\nHe thanked the little man, shouldered the spear, and went on\nfearlessly.\n\nBefore long he saw the beast, which rushed at him, but he held\nthe spear towards it, and in its blind fury it ran so swiftly\nagainst it that its heart was cloven in twain.  Then he took the\nmonster on his back and went homewards with it to the king.\nAs he came out at the other side of the wood, there stood at the\nentrance a house where people were making merry with wine and\ndancing.  His elder brother had gone in here, and, thinking that\nafter all the boar would not run away from him, was going to drink\nuntil he felt brave.  But when he saw his young brother coming out\nof the wood laden with his booty, his envious, evil heart gave him\nno peace.  He called out to him, come in, dear brother, rest and\nrefresh yourself with a cup of wine.\n\nThe youth, who suspected no evil, went in and told him about the\ngood little man who had given him the spear wherewith he had slain\nthe boar.\n\nThe elder brother kept him there until the evening, and then they\nwent away together, and when in the darkness they came to a\nbridge over a brook, the elder brother let the other go first, and\nwhen he was half-way across he gave him such a blow from behind\nthat he fell down dead.  He buried him beneath the bridge, took\nthe boar, and carried it to the king, pretending that he had\nkilled it, whereupon he obtained the king's daughter in marriage.\nAnd when his younger brother did not come back he said, the boar\nmust have ripped up his body, and every one believed it.\nBut as nothing remains hidden from God, so this black deed also\nwas to come to light.\n\nYears afterwards a shepherd was driving his herd across the\nbridge, and saw lying in the sand beneath, a snow-white little\nbone.  He thought that it would make a good mouth-piece, so\nhe clambered down, picked it up, and cut out of it a mouth-piece\nfor his horn,  but when he blew through it for the first time,\nto his great astonishment, the bone began of its own accord to\nsing -\n     ah, friend thou blowest upon my bone.\n     Long have I lain beside the water,\n     my brother slew me for the boar,\n     and took for his wife the king's young daughter.\n\nWhat a wonderful horn, said the shepherd, it sings by itself,\nI must take it to my lord the king.  And when he came with it to\nthe king the horn again began to sing its little song.  The\nking understood it all, and caused the ground below the bridge\nto be dug up, and then the whole skeleton of the murdered man\ncame to light.  The wicked brother could not deny the deed, and\nwas sewn up in a sack and drowned.  But the bones of the murdered\nman were laid to rest in a beautiful tomb in the churchyard.\n"
