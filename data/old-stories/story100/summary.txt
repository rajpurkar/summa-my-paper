Desiree has just given birth to her young boy and Madame Valmonde is coming over to visit the estate where Desiree and her husband, Aubigny live.  Valmonde is Desiree's adopted mother and has taken care of her since she first came upon the infant years ago.  Both are joyed at the baby's healthy demeanor and Desiree reports that Aubigny is so happy that he has become much more positive than his usually dark demeanor.  Several months past and Aubigny's demeanor changes significantly.  It's at this point they notice that the child's hair is not normal (read: white).  Aubigny accuses Desiree of having African heritage to which she has no clue.  He is angered by this and wants nothing to do with her, so she returns to Valmonde's.  Weeks later, Aubigny has a bonfire wherein he burns all of the baby's stuff that still remained.  Included in this collection is a group of letters from Desiree and one from Aubigny's mother from many years ago to his father that acknowledged her African heritage.
