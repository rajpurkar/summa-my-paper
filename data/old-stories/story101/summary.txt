Bobinôt is seriously infatuated with Calixta, even though she doesn't fully return the love.  She  proves a troubling character for the reserved nature of the town and that too, adds a bit to her appeal.  Bobinôt is not interested in going to the Acadian Ball on Saturday even though Calixta will be there but then learns that Alcée Laballière will be there and this concerns him enough to go.  Meanwhile, Alcée has just lost a significant amount of his wealth due to a cyclone whipping through his field and this, just after proclaiming his love for Clarisse, his mother's god-daughter and being largely rejected.  Late on Saturday night, he takes off the ball and Clarisse watches him go and discovers from the servant where he has gone.   At the ball, Alcée sneaks off with Calixta for a while and Bobinôt is left looking about for her helplessly.  Alcée is convincing Calixta to meet him in the city for what is clearly a tryst when Clarisse appears.  She tells him there is something he must come home for and he leaves Calixta.  Bobinôt finally finds her and she acquiesces to be his romantic partner, though with no enthusiasm.  Meanwhile, Clarisse brings Alcée and tells him that she wants to be with him.
