At a ticket offer, a man inquires of the narrator if he has insurance.  The man says he doesn't but would like to buy one for the next day when he will in fact be in bed and not travelling.  The man goes into a detailed explanation that when doing extensive research on the subject matter, he discovered that the statistical likeliness of dying while on trains or boats or other modes of transportation is significantly less than the likelihood of dying in bed.  To that end, he swears by only purchasing insurance when he knows he will be staying in his own bed as opposed to any other place that he encounters.
