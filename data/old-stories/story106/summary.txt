The story is a dedication of sorts to the John Does, the names bodies found in battle who fought and died and therein, lost their identify as well as those with names but become nearly nameless in their overwhelming mass of dead bodies that were accumulated in World War I.  These many different soldiers from their many different lives have both similar and different lives in America and soon went off to training and eventually war as teenagers and 20-somethings.  Many of them died and were brought back in the indistinguishable pine boxes and decorated with flowers by many who sent them off to war in the first place.
