The story introduces us to the Talmudist of Braniza, a highly celebrated and knowledgeable man who happens to have the most beautiful wife in the city.  The narrator explains that this is rare because typically, God hands out ugly brides to religiously faithful people because God knows they will take what he gives them.  One evening, the wife asks him when the Messiah will come and the husband explains that the Messiah will come when all Jewish people are entirely virtuous or entirely vicious.  The wife asks does he believe if the Jewish people will ever be entirely virtuous to which he scoffs at the idea.  A short time later, the husband goes away and when he returns he finds his wife with the Captain of the Hussars.  When he confronts her, she shows no shame and merely explains that she was just doing her part to help bring in the Messiah.
