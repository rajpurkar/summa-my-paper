It's evening in the year 2053 and Leonard Mead is out for an evening walk, just as he has for nearly a decade.  He wanders the abandon streets noticing the soft glow of the TV screen from everyone home he passes.  No one is out in the evening, they all huddle around the entertainment centers at their home.  However, a police car pulls him over when he is close to his home.  This is a strange event since there is only 1 police car in the city because crime has been so significantly reduced.  The police car is unmanned but can communicate.  It inquires what Mead is doing out at night and he explains he's walking.  After back and forth between the two, it's clear the idea of an evening walk is utterly foreign in this world.  The police car insists that he get in the car and is going to be taking to a psychiatric ward for his regressive tendencies.  As they drive away, they pass Mead's house which is the only one with lights on besides a television.
