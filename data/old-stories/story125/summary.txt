Captain Dan Barstow has been successful pilot in war and now, he's set to be the first man to go into space.  He preps for and is launched into space rather successfully.  The chaotic nature of space travel is a bit demanding as Barstow has to keep his eyes on many different things while also remaining in constant contact with mission control.  Out into space he flies and gets to see amazing sights.  However, he spots something unexpected, a second moon.  This moon is small (1 mile in diameter) and covered in dark rock, making it hard to spot by others.  Small as it is, the gravity is strong enough to pull his ship into orbit and eventually, he crashes (very lightly since the moon-side gravity is light).  With not enough rocket fuel to achieve escape velocity, Barstow assumes (as does mission control) that he will die on Earth's newly found, second moon.  However, while explore the moon, Barstow comes up with an idea and shortly after, he is reporting to command about his experience re-entering Earth's orbit and landing safely.  When asked how he managed to escape the moon, Barstow explains that he jumped off the moon because the gravity was that light and uses some small propulsion tools on his body to escape.
