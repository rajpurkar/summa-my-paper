The story begins with the narrator explaining a need for cooler and slower places and how a cat appeared and has come to sit on her lap.  She reflects on the nature of everything around her being in various ambiguous states or not doing the things that they are supposed to to be doing.  There is a clear instability and lack of clarity to the world around the narrator (who isn't even sure who she/he is).  She begins to focus on the cat and what it means to be a cat.  Someone knocks at the door and enters.  Though originally, she thought it was the mailman, she decided it was a dog--and it is a dog.  The man-dog sees the cat and says that it's Schr√∂dinger's cat and the two proceed to explain who that is and why it matters.  As to two talk, the cat walks over and leaps into a box.  When the narrator goes over to open it, the cat has disappeared.  Just after they open the lid to the box and note the cat's absence, the roof is torn off the ceiling and they are left pondering, "I wonder if he found what it was we lost?"
