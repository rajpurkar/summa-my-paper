Gummitch has a theory about himself.  As soon as he becomes mature, he will morph into his true human self and sit at the adult table with his true parents and drink coffee.  He is a genius but doesn't yet know how to speak human but once he does he will ascend to his proper place in the family.  His cat parents never learned to talk as such and therefore are left to be accepted as cats but his other siblings, the human baby and toddler named Sissy will eventually transform into cats.  But something's odd about Sissy and her repeated attempts to kill the baby and do other harmful acts.  Gummitch also believes in the mirror universe that he peers into every time he sees a mirror or reflective surface.  This world is filled with mere shells of the people who live in Gummitch's world, but desire to enter the real world.  So Gummitch must be careful with his ghost-self.  One night, Sissy sneaks into the baby's room where Gummitch often rests and he witnesses her bring a sharp object into the room and she has an evil look in her eyes.  Gummitch knows what's happening and leaps at Sissy, throwing his spirit into her to knock out the evil that is present.  As his spirit moves into Sissy, the ghost-Gummitch moves into Gummitch's old body.  The parents come in to see what's going on and with Sissy crying, Gummitch is sent to the basement for a few weeks.  When he comes out, he is aloof and less playful than when he was prior.  Sissy, on the other hand, becomes less violent and excels as a young child.
