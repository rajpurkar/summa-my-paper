"William Saunders" (a psuedonym the narrator uses) is done with open space.  Back on Earth and cleared by the psychiatrists, he is seeking employment that has nothing to do with any open spaces.  It's just too much for him to the point where he hides who he was and takes a low-ranking job.  At his new job, he eventually makes friends with a coworker named Tully who invites him over.  Dinner also includes Tully's brother-in-law who is an obnoxious person trying to berate his opinion into everyone.  The conversation comes to Mars and what to do with the Martians.  The brother-in-law prefers a more aggressive route, but William speaks up unexpectedly in their defense and we flashback to the Martian that he had met and respected.  Later on, when he is in bed, he hears crying from outside his window.  Slowly and with much trepidation, he eventually peers out the window to find a kitten stuck on a small landing outside his room.  It becomes clear that he will not be able to save the kitty unless he gets out on the ledge but his fear of open space makes it almost impossible.  It's at this point he flashes back to his experience in space where in order to save everyone on the spaceship.  He climbed about the ship to replace an essential antennae but in doing so, found his ability to get back into the ship impossible.  He clung to ship for as long as he could before losing his grip.  When he awakes, he is on a different ship that happened to be near by and could pick him up.  After reliving this flashback, William finds the courage to go outside and get the kitty and bring it in.  Upon coming back in, he begins to reconsider his choices and wonders if going outside is all that bad after all.
