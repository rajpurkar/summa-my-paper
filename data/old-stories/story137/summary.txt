Underhill is a pinlighter.  He along with others work on spaceships to help navigate them through hyperspace by means of telepathy and pairing with equally powerful and instinctive cats.  In travelling through space there are these entities (known as dragons to humans) that hunt down such fast-moving vehicles and destroys them.  The pinlighter with a chosen partner needs to blast the creature with light at the precise moment.  The game takes places in the time of milliseconds and can be deadly to both human and cat.  As the story starts, Underhill is slightly frustrated in the lack of respect he and his kind get for what they do which is save the everyone on the ship time and again at reasonable cost to their own health (recovery can take months).  We meet other pinlighters who have their quirks and their preferences for different partners.  Father Moontree is the oldest among them while West is the youngest among them but gets along with all the partners.  Underhill is suited up for another mission and paired with Lady May, whom he rather enjoys as a partner.  The two got to the fight room and begin to engage the enemy.  The battle is challenging and this dragon (or rat as it appears to the partners) is more vicious than anticipated.  During the battle, the dragon actually touches Underhill which usually results in near instance insanity but Underhill remains unscathed.  In the final moments of the story, feeling thankful about Lady May's abilities and overall majestic nature, he contemplates if he will ever find a woman like that.
