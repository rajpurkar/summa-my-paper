The story begins with a questionable person standing in a graveyard, snooping on the superintendent.  We are told that it is a shifty fellow and that it must be a reporter.  The story jumps back to earlier in the day when the editor of the Daily Malefactor in San Francisco summons a reporter through vacuum tubes to appear (it is the futuristic year of 1930 for this story that was published several decades earlier).  The editor insists that something sinister is going on with the cemetery and directs the report, Mr. Longbo Spittleworth (or agent 216) to investigate it.  The editor tells him that "go and 'seek the bubble reputation."  The reporter agrees but before fully leaving, the editor explains that it is the other man's bubble that is to be sought--not his own.  Once assured, 216 takes off and a few days later, scandalous headlines cover the Daily Malefactor.
