The narrator is invited over to Carnacki (a reoccuring character of Hodgson's) for dinner and discussion.  Carnacki shares a tale of his most recent adventures wherein he was asked to investigate a room in a castle that howls at night.  He explains how his friend believes it's the local folk trying to play a trick on him but as Carnacki investigates it, it seems uncertain.  He is eventually witness to the shrieking that occurs and decides he needs to do more research on it.  He returns a few weeks later only to find the castle entirely quiet.  He uses a latter to get up and see into the "whistling room".  He eventually sees a giant mouth in the room that looks to consume him entirely.  He falls from the latter and tells the owner to tear down the room entirely.  Upon researching further, they discover that the room was haunted by cursed jester from centuries before.  They also discover that soon-to-be wife of the owner who would be moving in was a descendant of the king who had tortured the jester.  The final thought of the story is to wonder what would have happened if she had step foot into that room.
