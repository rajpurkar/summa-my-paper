A rich family is planning for a garden-party in the afternoon.  The details of the day's arrangement have been left up to Laura, "the artistic one."  As she worries about proper appearance and such, she provides some guidance to the workers about how to arrange things--though in truth, it's their ideas that are most useful.  She finds them nice and romanticizes her interactions with them--believing she could learn to appreciate the working life.  Later on, it's reported that one of the people in the small row of shabby (and poor) houses nearby was accidentally killed and his wife and children are left to fend for their own.  Initially, this event upsets Laura to the point that she believes she should cancel the party.  Her sister and mother both scoff at the idea and find it silly.  Laura acquiesces and the party moves forward.  It goes successful and everyone has a good time.  Afterwards, when the father is present, the death of the neighbor is mentioned and Laura is lightly goaded about her previous idea.  It's then realized that there's lot of food and flowers and that it would be a nice gesture to share with the family.  Laura is assigned (after initial resistance to the idea) to bring it.  As she moves deeper into the impoverished area, she becomes increasingly fearful and uncomfortable with the surroundings.  By the time she arrives at the widow's house, it's all she can do but to run away.  She eventually finds herself with the widow and even the dead body before she escapes, feeling uncomfortable and unsure how to make sense of what she sees.  On her way home, she encounters her brother.  She is crying and ends by trying to make sense of life (and death).
