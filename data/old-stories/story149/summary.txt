The narrator, a young adult is tied up in nots of his friend's sister.  He's continually trying to catch glimpses of her and talk to her.  At one encounter, she asks him if he's going to Araby, an upcoming bizarre.  She cannot attend and he promises to bring her something from the bizarre.  He convinces his family to let him go but he must wait until his uncle is home.  Impatient, the young man laments about how long it takes for him to get to the bizarre.  Having finally arrived, he wanders a bit until he lingers at a stall but doesn't buy anything.  As the bizarre closes, he stares into darkness, angry and upset.
