There is a short story in this though it can be hard to fully explain.  The story is a lament by the first-person narrator about how he and Borges are bound together.  They are different but still inextricably tied together; so much so, that while the narrator tries to state who he is and who Borges is, he wonders if in fact it is even he who is writing the work being read.
