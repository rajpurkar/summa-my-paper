Hunger artists are people whose art is their ability to fast for long periods of time.  In this story, the unnamed hunger artist is considered the finest hunger artist to have ever lived.  However, his true talent for being a hunger artist is undermined by the skepticism of the spectators as well as by the impressario who always limited the fasting to 40 days.  The decision for this is because after 40 days, the audience fades away and the spectacle doesn't make as much money.  Eventually, the demand for hunger artists fade and he finds himself joining up with a circus.  He's happy about this because he is no longer inhibited by an artificial endpoint but equally disappointed because he is between the big tent performances and the animal cages.  Therefore, people pass by in a rush and pay little or no attention to him.  Time passes and he continues to fast.  However, people (including himself) has stopped keeping count.  Eventually, he is forgotten until a circus manager requests to clean the cage and use it for something else.  It's upon the cleaning of the straw that they find the shrunken hunger artist, barely clinging to life. At this moment, he dies, having completed his most successful art work but not before the reader learns that fasting was easy for him because he had never found a food that he loves and thus to go without food was not hard.
