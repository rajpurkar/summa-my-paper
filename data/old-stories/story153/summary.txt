Two waiters banter back and forth while waiting for an old deaf gentleman to leave the cafe.  Finally, the impatient and younger waiter of the two grows frustrated enough that he cuts off the old man so he can go home.  The older waiter scolds the younger for not understanding and appreciating what the old man seeks which is "A Clean, Well-Lighted Place" to sit and drink at into the night.  The cafe represents this where the bars, homes, and other such places do not.  The younger waiter does not understand this and rushes home to his wife whereas the older waiter lingers and eventually lands in a bar, lamenting in his mind about a deep sorrow.
