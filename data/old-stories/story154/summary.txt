The narrator stumbles upon a group of children at night hunting for insects.  They each carry a homemade self-styled lantern (often made from an empty carton).  As he watched, one boy claims to have found a grasshopper.  He stirs up excitement with the other children asking who wants the grasshopper.  A girl asks for it and he reaches into the bush and grabs hold of it.  When he pulls it out and offers it to the girl, she states that it is a bell cricket.  When they both lean closer to look at it with their lanterns, the boy's name, which is part of the stencil on the lantern is projected onto the girl's breast while the girl's name which is part of the stencil of her lantern is projected onto the boy's wrist.  The narrator observes this instance and muses on the nature of their future relationships and the ideas around meeting grasshoppers who are really bell crickets and vice versa.
