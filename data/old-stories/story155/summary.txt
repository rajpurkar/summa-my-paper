Rita visits a fortune-teller that tells her that her lover, Camillo will not leave her.  Camillo, an agnostic to all things spiritual chafes her for doing so as he is afraid it will expose their illicit affair to her husband (and his good friend).  Camillo stays away for Rita for some time, until an urgent message from her husband, Villela, requests his presence.  Camillo's anxiety about Villela's intent (Does he know?) holds him back until he stumbles upon the same fortune-teller that Rita visited.  He enters and she assures him that he and Rita will be fine.  Somehow assured by the mystic, Camillo races toward Villela's home, finding new inspiration and faith in the spirit realm.  Upon entering the house, he finds Rita dead and Vilella quickly dispatches him.
