Orrison Brown works odd jobs at a newspaper.  One day, he is directed to take Louis Trimble out to lunch.  The editor explains that Trimble has been away for nearly a decade.  Brown is instructed to take him to 21.  Trimble attempts to decline the invitation but the editor insists.  Brown begins to inquire about Trimble's past.  He explains that he was last present when they had begun the Empire State Building.  Brown keeps trying to get him to reveal where he has been but Trimble doesn't give it away directly.  When asked if he's been out of civilization for a while, Trimble says he has in sense, which makes Brown wonder if he was in prison or an asylum.  They arrive at 21 and Trimble says he remembers when that name became famous.  He suggests they try some other place.  Brown continues to guess at Trimble's background and current needs.  Through the discussion, Trimble reveals that he went to Massachusetts Tech.  When asked what he wants to see the most, Trimble answers with mundane things.  Brown begins to piece it together and Trimble eventually reveals that he was the architect of the Armistead Building, erected in 1928.  The realization final comes that Trimble had spent the intervening years entirely drunk and now, sober, wants to see the world anew.
