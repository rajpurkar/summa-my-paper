Martha Patch lives alone in a very small house removed from the road.  She is old and pieces together her living by doing odd jobs, mostly sewing and stitching.  She has two orders from Miss Bliss and Miss Bennet that she has received, which will provide her with money and food enough to get through the next few months. As she gets to work on the dresses, she finds her time filled up well, except when she occasionally thinks about having a window out the front of the house with which to see the road.  She cannot afford it and must settle for the rear window which looks out across the field.  She soon realizes that she has mixed up the orders from Bliss and Bennet and must undo everything that she has done.  She also needs to make sure she knows whose material is whose, so she takes a long trek to Miss Bennet's home to confirm.  She works long and hard, tirelessly and with increasingly less food.  She finally finishes, nearly exhausted after several weeks.  She goes to bed and the next morning, the morning she plans to deliver the dresses, she finds that she has utterly fatigued herself.  She falls on her way to the kitchen and is unable to get up.  She is stranded there for a while but luckily hears a neighbor that she begins calling for.  Her neighbor, Mrs. Peters manages to break in through the window and begins to help her out, providing food and helping her to bed.  Later, Mr. Peters shows up and explains that he plans to put in a front window because he's had this large piece of glass just taking up space.  Martha is dubious but agrees to it with much appreciation.  In addition, Mrs. Peters explains that she knows there are some other people who need some work, which Martha is excited to know.
