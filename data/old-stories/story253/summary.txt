Montresor holds a grudge against Fortunato and decides to enact his revenge. He invites Fortunato into the Montresor catacombs to taste a sample of some recently acquired Amontillado, and through a combination of false goodwill and pricks to Fortunato's pride, he brings the drunk Fortunato to a niche hidden deep within the catacombs. He tricks Fortunato into the niche and chains him there as he walls his enemy into the makeshift tomb.
