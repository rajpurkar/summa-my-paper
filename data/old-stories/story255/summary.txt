The narrator claims that he is not insane and offers the tale of why he killed the old man as proof. In the tale, he cannot stand the sight of the old man's eye, so he decides to carefully and methodically kill him, explaining that no madman would be as careful as he is. As he stifles the man, he hears what he perceives as the beating of the old man's heart. He dismembers the body and hides it beneath the floorboards, but when the policemen come, he is agitated by the sound of the loudly beating heart and is finally driven to reveal the truth to the policemen.
