After a particularly grisly double murder occurs in the Rue Morgue, leading to the arrest of Adolphe Le Bon on insufficient evidence, C. Auguste Dupin and his friend the narrator decide to investigate. Dupin is particularly skilled in analytical matters and feels that he can do a better job than the Paris Police, who are cunning but not insightful. The murder apparently takes place in a house where no one could have escaped and was committed by a perpetrator or perpetrators that were overheard but not seen and appear to have had no motive. Dupin, however, is able to retrace the steps of the murder by thinking creatively and questioning the assumption that the murderer is human.
