Monsieur G., the Prefect of the Parisian police, visits C. Auguste Dupin and the narrator to present them with an unusual case. Minister D., a clever and daring government official, has stolen a letter from a lady and thus gained power over her, which he has been using for political blackmail. The police have searched his apartment thoroughly but found nothing. Dupin advises that they search again, but when this attempt fails, G. offers a reward, which Dupin promptly takes before presenting the letter. Dupin later explains to the narrator that he retrieved it by reasoning that D. was clever enough to hide the letter in the most obvious place and by thus locating it in plain sight in D.'s apartment.
