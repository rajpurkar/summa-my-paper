The narrator falls in love with Ligeia, although he cannot remember the exact circumstances of their meeting, and they marry. He is in love with her beauty, spirit, and intelligence, but she falls ill and dies while claiming her belief that man only dies because his will is too weak. The despondent narrator moves to a desolate English abbey and marries Rowena Trevanion, although they do not love each other. Rowena soon falls ill and dies, but when he watches over her body, it repeatedly attempts to revive. Eventually, the corpse manages to walk, but the narrator, in a haze of opium, realizes that the corpse now has Ligeia's image rather than Rowena's.
