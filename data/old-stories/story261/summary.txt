As a child, the narrator, William Wilson, is disturbed by a boy who shares his name, birth date, and approximate appearance, and who seems to keep up with him effortlessly, although William tries hard to be the superior of his classmates. As William grows older, he descends into vice, but his most profligate deeds are continually interrupted by the shadowy visits of his former schoolmate. Finally, harassed to desperation, William stabs his rival only to find that he has, in a way, killed himself.
