The narrator has heard myriad stories of premature burials and becomes increasingly afraid of the possibility. He develops catalepsy and in his paranoia arranges for various backup plans in case something should go wrong and he should be declared dead. However, after a frightening awakening in what he believes to be a grave but then finally remembers is the berth of a ship, he realizes that he cannot live his life in fear, and his catalepsy retreats with the reestablishment of his nerves.
