The narrator comes with the old man to the top of a mountain, where he views the power of the Norwegian Maelström. The old man then tells the narrator a tale of his experience with the giant whirlpool. The old man and his brothers had been accustomed to braving the Maelström in order to fish, but one day, a hurricane drives their boat into the whirlpool. The old man survives through luck, bravery, and intelligence, but his brothers are not so lucky, and the experience makes the survivor visibly older.
