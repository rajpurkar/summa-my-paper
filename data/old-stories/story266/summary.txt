On the narrator's visit to Legrand's hut, he startles his friend by noting that Legrand's depiction of a new species of bug looks like a skull. A month later, Legrand's servant Jupiter asks him to accompany them on a trip to the hills on Legrand's island, although Jupiter and the narrator both believe that he is losing his sanity. Jupiter blames it on the bug's having bitten Legrand, but Legrand successfully leads them to a buried treasure and reveals how he had used the parchment of his sketch of the bug to find the treasure.
