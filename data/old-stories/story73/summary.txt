A woman has gone about unnaming all the animals and many of them are perfectly fine with that.  However, some animals had some resistance to the idea.  Yet others are happy to return their names.  Some of the more human-friendly pets such as dogs and birds were resistant to giving up their names.  The narrator explains that in unnaming them, she now feels closer to them as their names stood as a barrier to connecting to them.  The names created fear.  Her implied name is Eve (or Lilith) but it is never said for she too returns her name to Adam, thanking him but acknowledging she doesn't need it.  Adam accepts her decision with little second thought until it comes time for dinner.  She explains that she is going with "them" and it's here that she realizes it might be a bit complicated to actually communicate without words and to fully express herself--that she is in new terrain and must tread carefully.
