He returns again the next day for some beer and promises to return in the evening when the three bottles of wine will be ready as a gift.  Unfortunately, he does not return that night.  When he does come by to say goodbye, the wine they were supposed to get was drank up and they would need to get more.  When they go to get some more, the storehouse is locked and they cannot get in without risking letting others know that there are illegal booze in the storehouse.  They return back to the front of the house and chat briefly before leaving and it is clear that the narrator has disappointed the Fontans.
