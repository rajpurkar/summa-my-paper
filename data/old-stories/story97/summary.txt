Julia Westall attends a speech by her husband that she both likes and dislikes.  The premise of the speech--one that he is regularly discussing--explains that in marriage, one must be true to the self and not the marriage vow per se.  That is, marriage should no longer required an unhappy couple to cling together for so long.  Westall herself had confessed this and was part of the reason she married her husband after divorcing her previous husband.  However, her husband's vocalizing it in public while beginning to show eyes at a younger woman continues to irk and worry Julia.  She has several conversations with him but every time she tries to curtail his speaking out on it, he reminds her that this was her idea and why is it now that she would rescind such an idea.  It soon becomes apparent to Julia that her husband is losing interest in her and wishing to pursue the young woman.  The husband admits to this and that he will seek a divorce with her.  She is horror-stricken by the declaration and finds herself at a loss.  She eventually finds herself at the house of her ex-husband and seeks his presence.  During the conversation, she finally comes to an understanding of and full apology for how her actions towards him were much like what has happened to her.  He admits to feeling sorry for her because he does understand and she leaves.
