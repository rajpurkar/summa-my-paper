A husband and wife begin talking about what they would do if it was the last night on Earth.  They slowly begin to share that both of them have had dreams to that effect that this night would be the last night and that everything would end.  It would not end by violence or plague but just the world would end.  They realize that others have had this dream too and possibly even the children.  They realized that it is probably true but go ahead anyways with their nightly routine of closing down the house, turning off things, cleaning dishes, etc.  Finally, they go to bed and presumably the world ends.
